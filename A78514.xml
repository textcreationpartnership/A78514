            <title>The seventh-day Sabbath· Or a brief tract on the IV. Commandment. Wherein is discovered the cause of all our controversies about the Sabbath-day, and the meanes of reconciling them. More particularly is shewed 1. That the seventh day from the creation, which was the day of Gods rest, was not the seventh day which God in this law commanded his people to keep holy; neither was it such a kinde of day as was the Jewes Sabbath-day. 2. That the seventh day in this law commanded to be kept holy, is the seventh day of the week, viz. the day following the six dayes of labour with all people. 3. That Sunday is with Christians as truly the Sabbath-day, as was Saterday with the Jewes. / By Thomas Chafie parson of Nutshelling.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Tract on the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though little in Bulk, yet found great oppoſition before it could come to light. The Author was charged to be ſuch as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> whoſe hand was againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him; whereas next to the Glory of God in maintaining this his law to be in force, and his Sabbath to be obſerved, his principal ſcope is to diſcover the cauſe of all our Controverſies about the Sabbath-day, that ſo a mean may appear for ending all
<pb facs="tcp:118373:3"/>differences thereabout; and that the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given the Jewes of Chriſtians not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath-day be wholly removed.

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Believe thou art not ignorant of the many diſſenſions and contentions that have been among the People of God about the Sabbath-day. Some ſtood for the old Sabbath (ſo called by ſome) meaning the Jewes Sabbath-day. Some for a new Sabbath (ſo called by ſome) meaning the day of Chriſts Reſurrection. And ſome for no Sabbath but what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates do appoint. No ſmall Controverſies have been between all theſe about the Sabbath-day, as I believe thou knoweſt. But the ground and cauſe of all ſuch their Controverſies; and how for Peace and Agreement ſake it may be removed and taken away, I ſuppoſe thou doſt not know: both which I will diſcover unto thee.</p>
            <p>The ground of ſuch their differences is a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe words of the Commandment, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt do no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work.</hi> By the ſix dayes muſt be meant, either the ſix dayes of Gods work, or the ſix dayes of work with men: either the ſix firſt dayes at the Creation, in which God wrought, and made all things; or elſe the ſix work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes of the week in uſe with men where they live. So
<pb facs="tcp:118373:4"/>alſo the ſeventh day muſt relate to the ſix dayes of Gods work, or elſe to the ſix dayes of mens labour: it muſt be the ſeventh day from the beginning of the Creation, or the ſeventh day from mens beginning their ſix week-days of labour; It muſt either be the day of Gods reſt, which immediatly followed the ſix days of his work, or the day of reſt with men, which immediately follows their ſix dayes of work where they live.</p>
            <p>They, between whom the ſaid diſſenſions have been and are, have and do hold generally, that the ſeventh day muſt and doth relate to the ſix dayes of Gods labour, and not of mans: It muſt be, they all think, the very day of Gods reſt, the ſeventh day from the Creation. Thus they all thought that the Jewes Sabbath-day, which was from Fridayes Sun-ſetting to Saterdayes Sun-ſetting, was the preciſe day of Gods reſt: and every of their other ſix dayes of the week, to be the very ſame with the ſix dayes of the Creation, whether they lived in <hi>Judea,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Ophyr,</hi> or in any other place, it maketh no matter, think they. Though Sunday with Chriſtians be the day immediately following their ſix dayes of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and on which they having laboured ſix dayes, do then reſt from their labour according unto Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; yet at no hand will they yield Sunday to be the ſeventh day and Sabbath of the Lord: Sunday they hold to be the firſt day of the week, and the very ſame with the firſt day of the Creation with Chriſtians whereever they live. From this common errour ſprouted out vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions, which ſet them all at variance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Jewes, and ſuch as adhere to their ſuperſtition, do and will ſtill plead for the Saterday-Sabbath: the Saterday they believe to be the day of Gods reſt, the day
<pb facs="tcp:118373:4"/>he bleſſed and ſanctified: they cannot conceit well of a new Sabbath, they know not whence it is. Though an Angel ſhould come from heaven and tell them, that Chriſt the Sonne of God came into the world, and hath taken away their Sabbath, and hath eſtabliſhed another contrary to what God the Father inſtituted; ſo that whereas before they had the ſeventh day for a day of reſt, Chriſt inſtituted that ſeventh day to be a work-day: That whereas God the Father bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day, Chriſt took off the bleſſing from it, and gave it to the firſt day: That whereas God the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his people to work before they did reſt, Chriſt appointed them to reſt before they did work: That whereas before they were to work, and do all that they had to do in ſix dayes, and reſt on the ſeventh day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods example; now they muſt reſt on the firſt day, and work the ſix dayes after, which is contrary to Gods example. I ſay if an Angel from heaven ſhould come and teach them thus, they would not believe him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some there be, and they not a few, godly, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and tender-hearted Chriſtians; who knowing that the Church of God hath ever ſince our Saviours Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obſerved the Sunday for their Sabbath, and that not againſt, but with the approbation of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, do ſlight the Seventh-day Sabbath, and are tooth and naile for the firſt day of the week (ſo they count Sunday to be, neither can they count it otherwiſe, as long as they hold the Jewes Sabbath to be the ſeventh day from the Creation) believing that the Apoſtles of Chriſt by the appointment of our Saviour, changed the old Sabbath (ſo they call the Seventh-day Sabbath,) to
<pb facs="tcp:118373:5"/>the Sabbath of the firſt day of the week; ſo that now the Church of God is to reſt before they labour, and unto, not from their labour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some again, knowing that the Jewes Saterday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was Ceremonial and abrogated, do thence hold and maintain the Seventh-day Sabbath to be abrogated alſo; and for that they know not any other Sabbath-day appointed by divine Authority in ſtead thereof, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that Chriſtians now in time of the Goſpel are to have and keep no Sabbath-day at all.</p>
            <p>Thus kinde Reader, I have ſhewed thee the ground and cauſe of theſe various and different opinions about the Sabbath-day. Whence have iſſued moſt, if not all the Controverſies that are now on foot between them.</p>
            <p>The only mean to ſtop all future Controverſies, and bring all ſides to accord in one truth about the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, is to take away, and wipe off from their mindes the aforeſaid errour, which occaſioned all their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For as long as they or any ſide of them hold, that the ſeventh day which God bleſſed and ſanctified, and commanded to be obſerved by all his people, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the ſix dayes of Gods work, and not of mans; that is, as long as they hold the ſeventh day here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be the very day of Gods reſt, the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, they will never come to agree in the truth, but more and more differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will ſtill riſe. Whereas if they all conſent in the true underſtanding of the aforeſaid words of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the ſeventh day relateth to the ſix dayes of work with men, and ſo muſt be the day after the ſix week-dayes of labour with people whereever they dwell; Agreement then of all ſides will be had. That great ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb facs="tcp:118373:5"/>block given the Jewes of our not keeping the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, according to Gods Precept and Example, which doth ſo ſtave them off from affecting our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be wholly taken away; they cannot then but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we keep the ſeventh day of the week, the day following our ſix dayes of labour, the very Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day pointed out unto us here in this law. They alſo who now ſtand for a new Sabbath-day, who ſay the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is changed, and the firſt day of the week to have been inſtituted in ſtead of the ſeventh will have no ground for ſuch their aſſertion. And laſtly, they who ſay the Church of Chriſt never obſerved the Sabbath ſince Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, and would from the practice of the Apoſtles, and the Church of Chriſt argue the abrogation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath, will quickly be of another minde, and acknowledge, that as the Jewes obſerved that day for their Sabbath, which in this law was commanded by the Lord God, ſo Chriſtians alſo have ever done; they have obſerved the ſame day, the laſt day of the week, the day following their ſix dayes of labour according to Gods example.</p>
            <p>But Courteous Reader, haply thou doubteſt here, and wouldeſt be ſatisfied, that whereas God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth by this law all his obedient children to keep the ſeventh day of the week, which is the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, holy unto his honour: If the Jewes then keep the Sabbath-day on the ſeventh day of the week, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods command; How can Chriſtians who keep their Sabbath a whole day after, be ſaid to keep their Sabbath on the ſeventh day of the week too, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Commandment?</p>
            <p>For thy ſatisfaction herein, let me now ask thee one
<pb facs="tcp:118373:6"/>Queſtion like unto thine? thine anſwer to mine will ſatisfie thine owne.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Pope made a decree that all his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children ſhould keep the 25. day of <hi>December,</hi> which is Chriſtmas day holy to the honour of Chriſt. If the French then keep Chriſtmas-day on the 25. of <hi>December,</hi> according to the Popes decree; How can the Engliſh Papiſts, who keep their Chriſtmas-day full ten dayes after, be ſaid to keep their Chriſtmas-day on the 25. day of <hi>December</hi> too, according to the Popes decree?</p>
            <p>Thou wilt anſwer me, that the French and Engliſh Papiſts, did all of them keep their Chriſtians-day on the ſame day of the moneth, on the 25, day of <hi>December</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Popes decree: and that the reaſon why the 25. day of <hi>December</hi> with the French came to be ten dayes ſooner then with the Engliſh, was for that they began their moneths ſooner by ten dayes then the Engliſh did, ever ſince Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> altered their year. The like anſwer I give thee: the Iewes and Chriſtians all of them keep their Sabbath on the ſame day of the week, on the ſeventh day of the week: and that the reaſon why the ſeventh day of the week with the Iewes, came to be a day ſooner then it did with Chriſtians, was becauſe they began their week a day ſooner then they did before, and ſooner then the Gentiles did, and Chriſtians now do, and that did they ever ſince the Lord cauſed them, after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to alter their year and their moneths as I have ſhewed, in the 3. and 10. Chapters more fully.</p>
            <p>So that if we could agree in the true underſtanding of the aforeſaid words of the Commandment; that by the
<pb facs="tcp:118373:6"/>
               <hi>ſeventh day</hi> is not meant the day following Gods ſix dayes of work, but the day following mens ſix dayes of labour, all our controverſies about the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day will ſoon end.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to clear, and make apparent unto all men, that this is the true meaning, and that the ſaid words of the Commandment are ſo to be underſtood, I have in this enſuing Tract.</p>
            <p>Firſt, diſcover'd that old, and rotten root from whence this error of holding the day of Gods reſt to be the ſame with the Jews Sabbath, whereever they lived, had its firſt ſpring: and that was from a meer ſuppoſal of the earths ſuperficies to be plain as a champion field, as is ſhewed fully in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> Indeed if the earth be plain, every day muſt be the ſame day with all people. Every of the ſix dayes at the creation muſt be every where the ſame day of the week, and ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day from the firſt beginning of the creation, the day of Gods reſt muſt be the ſeventh day of the week with the the Jews in <hi>Judea,</hi> in <hi>Ophir,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in all other places: the which cannot be if the earth be round, as thou mayeſt ſee more at large in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the dayes of the week begin ſooner in ſome places then in other; Then ſo may the day of Gods reſt alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> One and the ſame week-day doth not begin ſooner in ſome places then in other. The day which men call Sunday at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> begins ſooner then the day we call Sunday here: But they be not both one and the ſame day. One and the ſame day is for one and the ſame place only. If one and the ſame day ſhould begin ſooner in ſome places then in other, then
<pb facs="tcp:118373:7"/>it muſt needs be that either it muſt begin in ſome one place or other firſt, before it began in any place elſe either Eaſt or Weſt thereto; or elſe that it was infinite without any firſt beginning at all. Either of which no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man will affirme; much leſſe that the day of Gods reſt begins ſooner in one place then in another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have proved ſufficiently that the day of Gods reſt could not be the ſame with the Iews Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, nor the ſame kinde of day; and that all, and every of the dayes of the creation were farre different from week-dayes that were in uſe with the Iews, or are, or at any time have been in uſe with men. To this purpoſe I have ſhewed what kinde of dayes our week-dayes be; and what the Iews week-dayes be; and what the dayes of the creation were: and how they all differ in kinde from each other, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And then what kinde of day the Sabbath-day muſt be in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have ſhew'd, what day the Sabbath-day is to be in reſpect of order and tale. That it is to be the <hi>ſeventh day:</hi> Not the ſeventh day from the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the creation, nor the ſeventh from any ſet <hi>Era, or Epoche,</hi> but the ſeventh day from the time we begin the week for labour where we live, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Concerning which I have ſhewed, why the Lord ſet the Iſraelites a time when they, after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> muſt begin their week; whereby in count of their week-dayes, and ſo alſo of their ſeventh ſacred day they differed from all other Nations, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8, 9, 10. and what weeks be; and the difference between a week, and the week: and between a ſeventh day of the week, and the ſeventh day of the week; which laſt is
<pb facs="tcp:118373:7"/>the Lords day, or Sabbath of the Lord, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11, 12. and alſo the antiquity of weeks, and, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto to the main objection thereto in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I have ſhewed that Sunday was of old the ſeventh day of the week with the Gentiles, and moſt probably was the ſeventh day of the week alſo with the Patriarchs before the flood; and hath continued with Chriſtians their ſeventh day of the week even unto this preſent day; and doubtleſſe ever will to the worlds end, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, my hearty deſire is that thou, and all other the obedient ſervants of Ieſus Chriſt be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed concerning our obſervation of the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Haply thou didſt before the reading hereof hold, that <hi>this fourth Commandment is a branch of the moral law; that it is agreeable to the law of nature to have a day in ſeven to be for Gods worſhip; that Sunday is our chriſtian Sabbath; as Saterday was the Jews Sabbath; and that as God wrought ſix dayes, and rested the ſeventh, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated the ſeventh day unto holineſſe and rest, even ſo all Gods obedient people ſhould not be ſlothful, but diligent in their callings on the ſix work dayes, and reſt on the Sunday according to Gods example, and keep it holy.</hi> If this was thine opinon thou wert in the right, and didſt hold nothing in all theſe but what godly and learned men, and the ſervants of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did generally teach in former time the people of God here in <hi>England,</hi> as may plainly appear to thee, if thou readeſt only that Homily, which is for the <hi>time and place of Gods worſhip.</hi> But ſince that, ſubtile heads have been imployed to the ſubverting
<pb facs="tcp:118373:8"/>hereof, and bringing in a dangerous errour, opening a floodgate to all licentionſneſſe on the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they have publickly taught and publiſhed to the world, that <hi>the ſeventh day commanded to be kept holy, is none other but the day of Gods reſt.</hi> They would bring People in hand, that the Iewes Sabbath was the very ſeventh day from the Creation, and none other but that to be the ſeventh day of the week with any People, and ſo Sunday to be with us the firſt day of the week. To this end (I ſuppoſe) they would have the name of our Sabbath-day, which the Jewes called in their tongue <hi>The firſt day of the Sabbath,</hi> to be tranſlated (as it is in our Bibles) not <hi>The Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Sunday,</hi> by which names Chriſtians (whoſe Anceſtors were Gentiles,) ever called it, but <hi>The first day of the week;</hi> that ſo People may conceive hereby (though a new name doth not alter the nature of the thing) that Sunday with us is not in order <hi>the ſeventh day of the week,</hi> viz. <hi>the day following the ſix dayes of labour, but the day going before the ſix dayes of labour with us,</hi> and therefore not the Sabbath-day here commanded; for the rooting out of which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and confirming all in the truth concerning the Lords day, I have ſent abroad this little Tract. If now by thy ſerious peruſal hereof thou art the more encouraged to render the Lord his due honour in the heedful obſervation of the Lords day, which with us is Sunday; not for cuſtoms ſake, becauſe thy fore-fathers, and the Church of God ever obſerved the ſame ſince the time of the Apoſtles: nor for that the Magiſtrates have commanded us to keep this day holy: Nor for that the ſeventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb facs="tcp:118373:8"/>is aboliſhed, and this to be a new Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: but for that God in this his law which is perpetual and unalterable, hath commanded thee, and all People, expreſly to keep holy the ſeventh day; Give God the glory, and lift up a Prayer unto him for me a poor ſinner.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The Vniverſal day. The dayes of the Creation. Why</hi> Moſes <hi>ſet the Evening before the Morning.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal day</hi> is, that which is one, and the ſame day in all places through the whole Univerſe; as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its beginning, as of its duration, and ending. It is not one day at one part of the earth, and another day at another part; but when it beginneth or endeth any where, it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or endeth every where at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>This kinde of Day cannot properly be ſaid to begin either in the Eaſt or in the Weſt, or at Sun-riſing, or at Sun ſetting, or at Midnight, or at Noon, as other kinde of dayes do. For there is neither Eaſt nor Weſt, nor Sun-riſing nor Sun-ſetting; nor midnight nor noon in reſpect of the world; though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the parts of the world, all and every of theſe may be ſaid to be; yet ſo as what is Eaſt or morning to one part, is Weſt or Sun-ſetting to another part; and midnight to one part is midday to another part; but neither of them properly can be ſo ſaid to be the whole world. Such kinde of dayes were thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.5, 8, 13, 19 23.31.</note> And of which mention is made in this text and elſewhere
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 20.11. and 31.17. Acts 2.20. Rev. 6.17. 2 Pet. 2.9. and 3.7, 10. Ioel. 2.31.</note>. <hi>In ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, &amp;c. and reſted the ſeventh day.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118373:11"/>
               <p>That theſe dayes (which ſome do terme, and fitly enough may be called <hi>The dayes of the Creation</hi>) were ſuch Univerſal dayes, I will endeavour to clear, by giving inſtances in every of them which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, in rehearſing the Works of the Creation.</p>
               <p>The firſt of thoſe ſeven dayes was ſuch an Univerſal day, when it began any where, it began every where; no where then was it no day, nor any other then the firſt day.</p>
               <p>The firſt things God made were day and night: or light and darkneſſe. They were neither of them in time before the other, but were both coëtaneous.</p>
               <p>There was in nature before, though not in time, a mixed or confuſed darkneſſe, which <hi>Moſes</hi> called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 1.2.</note> which <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> correcting <hi>Pagnin,</hi> tranſlateth and calleth it <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligo;</hi> it was neither perfect day nor perfect night.</p>
               <p>But when God had thence formed the light, and made it to ſhine out of the darkneſſe
<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note>, and had divided the light from the darkneſſe, ſo as that they ſhould never be both in one Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, but ſucceed in order each other, which is called Gods Covenant of the day and of the night
<note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 33.20.</note>. God then called that light ſo divided Day, and that darkneſſe ſo divided, called by <hi>Moſes</hi> emphatically <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God called night
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1.4, 5.</note>; the full Revolution of both which was the firſt day; in this diviſion of the light and darkneſſe, or day and night, though the night was before the day in one Hemiſphere, and the day before the night in the other; yet in reſpect of the whole Univerſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them was before the other in time. When the firſt day began ſomewhere when it was night at the ſame time that firſt day began ſome otherwhere when it was day-light; every where did the firſt day begin at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day &amp; the third day in like maner were univerſal days. When God ſtretchd out the firmament on the ſecond day, it was every where then the ſecond day. On the next day alſo, wherſoever God the Univerſal Worker did his work, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole round, in gathering together the waters, making the ſeas and dry land, there every where was it the third day. And after that every where was it the ſame third day, where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118373:11"/>God made the earth to bring forth graſſe, and herbes, and fruit-trees
<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 1.11, 12, 13.</note>, no where was it then either the ſecond or fourth day.</p>
               <p>The fourth day in which the Sunne, Moone and Starres were made, was an Univerſal day. When it was the fourth day any where, it was the fourth every where. It is not revealed in what part of the fourth day thoſe lights of heaven were made; but moſt certain is it, that when the Sunne firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world on that day, it was over ſome part of the earth at that time, making it to be noone there, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in that Hemiſphere, which were in the ſame Meridian with the Sunne. And that in many places ninety degrees Eaſt from thence <hi>it was Sun-ſetting;</hi> and in as many places ninety degrees Weſt from thence, it was then at the ſame time <hi>Sun-riſing.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that in the other Hemiſphere to which the Moon or Stars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, it was then night, and midnight there in thoſe places that were in the ſame Meridian with the Sunne. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though on that fourth day Sun-ſetting was before Sun-riſing in ſome places, and Sun-riſing before Sun-ſetting in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; and in ſome places noone was before either of the other; and in ſome other places mid-night was before them all; yet in reſpect of the whole earth not one of them was on that fourth day before the other: But at the Sunnes firſt appearing, and ſhining over half the earth, it was at that very inſtant the fourth day, as well where it was Sun-ſetting, or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, as where it was noone: and likewiſe it was then the fourth day alſo in the other part of the earth to which the Moone, or Starres firſt appeared; For neither the Sun, Moone or Starres appeared to any place on the third day, which was the day before they were made, and the fifth day was not then begun.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay for the fifth day, and for the ſixth day; when God made fiſh and fowle on the fifth day; or when he made <hi>Adam</hi> the laſt of his creatures on the ſixth day, it was then after Sun-ſetting in ſome places, and before Sun-riſing in ſome other places; and it was then noone in ſome places, and mid-night in ſome other places, yet all on the ſame day.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay alſo for the ſeventh day, the day of Gods reſt:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118373:12"/>When God reſted from all his works that he had made, it was no where then the ſixth day, but every where the ſeventh day. The day of Gods reſt began in ſome places at Sun-riſing, in ſome places at Sun-ſetting, and in ſome at noone, and in other ſome at mid-night in the ſame day. For ſo was it on the fourth day when the Sunne firſt appeared, and ſo when it was halfe ended; and ſo likewiſe when it was fully ended; and therefore ſo was it when the fifth, ſixth or ſeventh day began, or ended. It is not revealed, and therefore no man can know, what, or where in the earth thoſe places are, where it was Sun-riſing, or Sun ſetting, or noone, or mid-night, either when the Sun firſt ſhined forth to the world, or when halfe of that fourth day was ended, or when it was fully ended; and therefore no man can tell, nor poſſibly can any finde out, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here in <hi>England,</hi> (or in any other particular place or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) it was Sun-ſetting or Sun-riſing, noone or mid-night, day-light or night, when the fifth, ſixth or ſeventh day, the day of Gods reſt began, and yet at the beginning of that ſeventh day it was either of theſe ſomewhere or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, why then did <hi>Moſes,</hi> rehearſing every of the ſix dayes work of the Creation, ſet the evening before the morning, ſo if the evening was not before the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Moſes</hi> naming the evening in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the morning in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31.</note>, doth not thereby make either of them to be in time before the other; one he was to name firſt; and the reaſons why he named the evening before the morning, may be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that after the Iſraelites deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (and I ſuppoſe this Hiſtory to be written after that) their year, their moneths, and the dayes of their week were all changed in reſpect of their beginnings and endings; ſo that whereas they began their dayes with the morning; thenceforth they conſtantly began their week-dayes with the evening
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sec</hi> chap. 3.</note>; as I ſhall ſhew more at large in the next Chapter. If <hi>Moſes</hi> now ſhould have ſet the morning before the evening, he might have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſlike this their new cuſtome of beginning their dayes of the week with the evening, for which he had direction from the Lord God.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118373:12"/>
               <p>Secondly, or elſe it may be for that they, (who were beſt skild in dividing, and diſtinguiſhing of time, as were Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; ſuch as doubtleſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>who was learned in all the wiſdome of the Egyptians</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 7.22.</note>) began the day at noone, making the evening, that is, all the time from noone to midnight to be the former part of the day; and the evening, that is all the time from mid-night to noone to be the latter part; as I will more fully ſhew in the fourth Chapter

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The Horizontal day.</hi> What the parts of the Horizontal day are: And which part is the former.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Horizontalday</hi> with any Nation, is that ſpace of time in which the Sunne is in going from their <hi>Horizon</hi> at its riſing, untill it cometh again into their <hi>Horizon</hi> at its next ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: or from their <hi>Horizon</hi> at its ſetting, untill it come unto their <hi>Horizon</hi> again at its next ſetting; or more briefly thus.</p>
               <p>The Horizontal day is the time between Sun-riſing and Sun-riſing, or between Sun-ſetting and Sun-ſetting.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Horizontal day are two; the one is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial day, or day light, of which we may read of in <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.5, 14, 16. and 8.22. and 31.39.</note>, the other part is the night or darkneſſe, called by
<note n="b" place="margin">Clav. de Sphoer.</note> 
                  <hi>Clavius</hi> the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial night; and which in ancient times was divided with the Jewes into three watches: the evening watch, the middle watch, and the morning watch; but after that when they were ſubdued by the Romanes, they divided the night as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes did into four watches.</p>
               <p>The Artificial day, or day-light was anciently counted to be the former part of this day, and the night the latter part, and ſo not only before the Iſraelites coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but after their deliverance did they count this day ſo to begin in reſpect of their civil affairs, as may appear,</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that when the parts of this day were mentioned, the morning was ſet before the night, before the Iſraelites com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118373:13"/>out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 1.16, 18. an 8.22, and 7, 4, 12.39.39, 40.</note>; yea and commonly, afterwards too
<note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 8.35. Ex. 13.21, 22. Numb. 9.21.</note>, though they had the beginning of their dayes altered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe at what time ſoever of the day-light they ſpake of the night following, they expreſſed the ſame thus, <hi>To night, this night, this ſame night</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 19.34. and 26.24. 1 Chron. 17.3. Numb. 11.32 Ioſ. 4.3. Iudg. 6.25. and 79.</note>, as belonging to the ſame day, and not to the day after that. And whenever they at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time of the day-light, ſpake of the night paſt, they never uſed ſuch expreſſions, whereby it may ſeem to belong as a part of the day following, but contrariwiſe, ſhewing it to be a part of the day before-going; as yeſternight
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 31.42 and 19.33.34.</note>, the night of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Alſo at night when they ſpake of the day following, they uſed not to ſay <hi>To day, or this day,</hi> as they did of the day before-going; but <hi>To morrow, or the morrow after</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Numb. 33.3. 1 Sam. 19.11.</note>, and to morrow ſignifieth another day
<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 6.34. Jam. 4.13, 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>When the Iſraelites came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the night was made the former part of the day, even from that night in which they had their deliverance. <hi>It was a night to be much obſerved unto the Lord, for bringing them out from the land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>This is that night of the Lord, to be obſerved of all the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their generations</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 12.42.</note>. They were commanded after that time, to celebrate their Sabbath from <hi>Even</hi> to <hi>Even</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 23.32.</note>. And therefore ſo did they begin their week-days alſo, whereby their Sabbath-day was meaſured out to be unto them their ſeventh day; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their ſeventh day would not have been proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſix dayes of labour. Their yeare alſo had thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth a new beginning. They muſt not begin their year in <hi>Tiſri</hi> as they did before, but with that moneth in which they had their freedome. <hi>This moneth ſhall be unto you the beginning of moneths</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Exod 12.2.</note>. This moneth called by the Hebrewes <hi>Abib</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 13.4. and 23.15. Deut. 16.1.</note>, and by the Chaldeans <hi>Niſan</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Eſth 147.</note>, (which conſiſted partly of our <hi>March,</hi> and partly of <hi>April,</hi> being with them the moneth after the Vernal Equinoctial,) was their firſt moneth thenceforth; ſo that whereas before they began their year after their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and after all their in-gathering of the fruits of the earth was ended
<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 23.16. and 34.22.</note>, which was partly in our <hi>September;</hi> after this they were to begin their year fartheſt off from that time. They had then a new yeare, and a new moneth, and a new day, to begin their year withal. <hi>No otherwiſe then if the day of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118373:13"/>their deliverance had been their birth-day; for their deliverance was a kinde of a new birth unto them: The beginning of the yeare was then changed, for the greater luſtre unto the birth of the Church,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin. And a new time of the day had they to begin their firſt day of the yeare, (for their</hi> Caput anni, <hi>or New-yeares day was a ſacred day with them) they began it at even at the going down of the Sunne, at the ſeaſon they came forth out of the land of</hi> Egypt
<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 16.6.</note>; then was their deliverance made and ſealed up unto them in the Paſſeover. So that although in reſpect of their Civil affairs they began their yeare, their moneths and their dayes as they did before, yet in this their New, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, or Sacred yeare, or Computation of time, they began their day at <hi>Even.</hi> All their Sabbath-days, and all other their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred dayes, and ſo all their week-dayes, for meaſuring out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them their ſacred dayes began at the <hi>Even:</hi> they had the evening to be the former part of the day. And this may be one reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> in rehearſing the works of Creation, ſetteth the evening before the morning, as I ſaid before

               <p>THe <hi>Miridional day</hi> is the time from midnight to midnight, or from noon to noon with any People, or more largely thus. The Meridional day with any People, is that ſpace of time in which the Sun is in going from their Meridian at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, until it come into that part of their Meridian again at their next midnight; Or elſe from their Meridian at noon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it come into that part of their Meridian again at noon.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Meridional day are theſe two, <hi>The Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Evening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Morning is all that time in which the Sun is in its riſing, until it come unto its greateſt height: that is, all the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween midnight and noon is the morning.</p>
               <p>And the Evening is all the time the Sun is in its deſcending,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118373:14"/>that is, all the time between noon and midnight.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſtians generally now do, &amp; formerly have counted and called theſe parts of this day. If common ſervice unto God hath been done in Churches or Colledges, at any time in the forenoon, either at three, foure, ſix, nine or eleven of the Clock, it was commonly called by the name of <hi>Mattins, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſervice,</hi> or <hi>Morning-Prayer,</hi> and if it had been done at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time in the afternoon, it was then commonly called <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Song, Evening-Prayer, Evening-ſervice,</hi> or ſuch like, though it had been done by day-light, or by Candle-light. So alſo the People of God did in ancient times divide the day into ſuch parts; one whereof they called the Morning, and the other the Evening
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 29.23. Eccleſ. 11.6. 1 Sam. 17.16. Ier. 6.4.</note>, though an act was done before day, yet did they count it to be done in the morning
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 31.55.</note>. <hi>Laban</hi> roſe early in the night, according to the vulgar tranſlation, which in ours is early in the morning. The like is ſaid of <hi>Moſes

                  </gap>. that is, the darkneſſe or night yet in being
<note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 20.1.</note>, notwithſtanding that time was counted to be in the morning, and the time of our Saviours Reſurrection was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, yet was it in the morning.</p>
               <p>This kinde of day, that is the Meridional day is, and ever hath been in common uſe with all Chriſtians, who do and have counted the day as their Heathen anceſtors did before them: after midnight reckoning one, two, three, (and ſo to twelve of the Clock) in the morning; and the like in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon for the evening. So we at this time do begin the day from midnight, making the morning to be the former part of the day; and the evening the latter part. So did the Egyptians who were for dividing and obſerving of time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; and ſo did the Romanes, and accordingly ſo did Chriſtians begin the day from midnight. <hi>Aegyptii &amp; Sacerdotes Romani à media nocte in alteram mediam noctem numerabant diem, quae conſuetudo adhuc in Eccleſia Romana permanſit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Clavius</hi>

In like manner did the Jewes begin the day with them in their ordinary &amp; common account of time, making the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be the former part of the day; though the Jewes from their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> began all their ſacred dayes or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118373:14"/>from the time of the ſetting of the Sun
<note n="d" place="margin">See chap. 3.</note>, and alſo the dayes ſerving to mete out to them their ſacred dayes
<note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 13.6, 7. Lev. 23.5, 6. Ex. 12.18, 19 Deut. 16.4.</note>, all which were Sabbatical dayes, and called by the Jewes, <hi>The firſt day of the Sabbath, the ſecond day of the Sabbath, &amp;c.</hi> for thus they called the dayes of their week or Sabbath. Yet otherwiſe commonly and generally, they continued to count their day to begin with the morning as before. Never did they begin any day of their moneth, but with the morning, making the evening to be the latter part of the day. As for inſtance, the day before their coming out of <hi>Rameſes,</hi> was the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>Abib
<note n="g" place="margin">Num. 33.3. Ex. 12.6.18.</note>. In that night,</hi> that is, in the night of that fourteenth day, <hi>they did eate the Paſſeover
<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 12.8.</note>, and in that night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the morrow, they burned what of the Paſſeover they are not
<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 12.10.</note>, and not one after that till midnight was past, and the morrow come, was to go out of the door of his houſe

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 12.30. 31, 32, 33, 34, 37.</note>. Whence it is evident that the evening in which they ate the Paſſeover, and were not to ſtir out of doors till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was part of the fourteenth day, and that the time after midnight, in which they were urged to haſte away, and in which they went abroad out of doors to provide their cattel, to conſult about their journey, and their going from <hi>Rameſes,</hi> was on the fifteenth day. <hi>They ate the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over on the fourteenth, and took their journey on the fifteenth day</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Numb. 33.3.</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The fleſh of the Peace-offering was to be eaten on the ſame day it was offered, and might not be eaten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whole evening was fully paſt. The ſame may appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if the offering had been a vow
<note n="k" place="margin">Lev. 7.15, 16, 17, 18.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the day in which Jeſus Chriſt ate the Paſſeover with his diſciples, was the fourteenth day of the moneth: on the ſame day Chriſts diſciples asked him, where they ſhould provide and prepare for him to eat the Paſſeover, and on the ſame day <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, and the Cock crew
<note n="m" place="margin">Mar. 14.30. Luke 22.34.</note> I ſay, the Queſtion demanded of Chriſt by his diſciples, the killing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118373:15"/>the Paſchal Lambe, the eating the Paſſeover, <hi>Peters</hi> denying this Maſter, and the Cocks crowing, were all done on one and the ſame day of the moneth; though the eating the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Peters</hi> denial, and the Cocks crowing, were done in the evening, in the latter part of that fourteenth day.</p>
               <p>The Aſtronomers eſpecially, and ſome others in ancient times, began the Meridional day at noon. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Holifax</hi> telleth us, that the Arabians began their day at noon, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this reaſon for it; <hi>Becauſe when the Sun was made and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the world, it was then in a Meridian</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Jo. de ſacr. Boſc. in libello de Computo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtice.</note>. In the day ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at noon, they had the ſame parts of the day, <hi>viz.</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, only they made the evening to be the former part. And it is more probable then otherwiſe, that when the Sun was made, and firſt appeared to the world, it was then in the ſame Meridian that Paradiſe was of, making it then to be noon there: At that time doth the Sun ſhew it ſelf with the greateſt light,
<note n="a" place="margin">Deut 28.29. Iob 11.17, 5.14. Pſal. 37.6. Iſa. 59.10. Amos 8.9.</note> luſtre, ſtrength and glory: making it to be Sun-riſing, ninety degrees from it weſtward; and Sun-ſetting, ninety degrees from it Eaſtward: and day-light in all places in either ſide. Now I ſee no reaſon, and I think no man can give any to the contrary, but that the Sun ſhould rather thus appear in its glory unto Paradiſe firſt, then unto <hi>Spain, Judea, America,</hi> or to any other place whatſoever. And then if ſo, <hi>Moſes</hi> had good reaſon even from hence to ſet the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the morning
<note n="c" place="margin">See chap. 2.</note>. And then it is likely that God made the living creature after his kinde, and <hi>Adam</hi> alſo in the afternoon, and that in the night following, (I mean when it was night in Paradiſe, though it was then day in ſome other places,) the deep ſleep fell on <hi>Adam,</hi> when God made the woman, and that ſhe was brought unto him in the morning. The naming of the creatures may be after this for ought we know to the contrary, yet all before the next evening, that is, before the next day, beginning at noon there.</p>
               <p>But if any will contend, that unleſſe there be better proofs given then probabilities, we ſhould not conceive the dayes of the Creation, either the fourth, ſixth or ſeventh, to begin in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe rather at noon then at midnight, Sun-riſing or at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting. Yet ſure it is more then probable, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118373:15"/>have the evening to begin at noon. What elſe could he mean by the <hi>two Evenings,</hi> which he in divers places mentioneth
<note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 29.39. Numb. 28.4, 8.</note>, if he meant not thereby the time between noon and Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>viz.</hi> the time between the evening of the day in common uſe with the Jewes which began at noon, and the evening of the day in their ſacred account, which began at Sun-ſetting, as I ſhewed before
<note n="g" place="margin">See chap. 2.</note>. On the fourteenth day of <hi>Abib,</hi> they were commanded, even the whole Aſſembly, to <hi>kill the Paſchal Lambe between the two evenings</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 12.6.</note>, as it is according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text; and to eat the ſame at the beginning of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred day of the Paſſeeover, which began at Sun-ſetting
<note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 16.6. Luke 22.14.</note>. Their taking the Lamb, killing, skinning, and making it coole and fit for roaſting; yea the roaſting it, and preparing it with herbs for the table, al was to be done between the two evenings before the ſetting of the Sun. The killing their Paſſeover (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely) was about that very time of the day when Chriſt our Paſſeover was ſlain, which was between the two evenings; The former of the two evenings mentioned by <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 12.6.</note>, began at noon, at the beginning of the ſeventh houre of the day with the Jewes.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Lyranus, According to the Hebrew Doctors, the Evening here mentioned, beginneth from the ſeventh houre, for at that time the Sun beginneth to incline toward the Weſt</hi>

                     <hi>Lyra. on</hi> Ex. 12.6.</note>. The ſeventh houre with the Jewes ever began at noon, as their firſt houre began at Sun-riſing. <hi>Maſius</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the difference between thoſe foure kindes of dayes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving ſhewed what all and every of thoſe foure kindes of dayes are. I will now ſhew how they differ from each other.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Artificial day differeth from all the other three, in that it hath only day-light and no night, but endeth at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting, whereas the other have night as well as day-light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Univerſal day differeth from horizontal dayes and meridional dayes in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Univerſal day is conſtant and unalterable; it cannot be made longer or ſhorter by all the wit and induſtry man can uſe, much leſſe may a day thereof be gotten or loſt by mans indeavour. But week-dayes with all People whether they be Horizontal or Meridional dayes, may be either leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by travelling Weſtward, or ſhortened by travelling Eaſt, yea a whole day may thereby be either gotten or loſt, and ſo he that was the firſt-born may become the younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in the Law-Caſe between <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Johannes,</hi> I will not affirm the ſtory to be true, but it will ſerve to illuſtrate the truth of what I before ſaid, and let it be taken as I had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Douſe</hi> of <hi>Portingh</hi> had by his wife <hi>Hellen</hi> two ſonnes at one birth, within one houre, and either of them was named <hi>John,</hi> but for diſtinctions ſake, the father and others called the younger <hi>Johannes.</hi> When they came to be five and twenty years of age, <hi>John</hi> the elder obtained moneys and leave of his father to travel with Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> when he made his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age round the world. <hi>Johannes</hi> lived at home with his aged father, his mother being dead; but did ſo miſ-behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf toward his father, that the old man, by his continual vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation became ſo weak and faint, that he deſpaired of life; yet before he died he heard that his ſon <hi>John</hi> was returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> ſafe with Sir <hi>Francis Drake:</hi> whereupon he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Will to be altered and new written, wherein he gave
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118373:16"/>all his goods and chattels to <hi>John</hi> his elder ſonne; ſaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ten pounds, which he gave to <hi>John</hi> his younger ſonne, and ſhortly after died. When <hi>John</hi> had heard of his fathers death, he haſted home; but before his coming, <hi>Johannes</hi> had in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and diſpoſed of all his fathers goods and chattels left. Of all which <hi>Iohn</hi> at his coming home demanded the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to whom <hi>Iohannes</hi> tendred only ten pounds, telling him that was all which his father gave him, and therewithal gave him a Copy of his fathers Will; telling him alſo that he by his travel had loſt a day of his age, and that he himſelf was <hi>Iohn</hi> the elder, when his father made his laſt Will, and being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the goods he meant to keep them. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reſolution would not finger the ten pounds, but took the Copy of the Will, and haſted to <hi>Plowden,</hi> commonly called <hi>Ployden,</hi> the Lawyer; to him he opened his Caſe, and ſhewed the Copy of the Will, craving his Counſel, <hi>Ployden</hi> having peruſed the Will, demanded of <hi>Iohn</hi> who was firſt-born, that was I, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> and my brother doth and will acknowledge that. Why then your Caſe is good and ſure, and the goods are all undoubtedly yours, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> but yet tell me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what pretence doth your brother claim and detain them? Why, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> he ſaith, that by my voyage that I made with Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> round about the world I loſt a day of my age, and ſo he at the making of the Will was the elder, and ſo layeth claim to all. Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> did take ſuch a voyage indeed, but did you travel the whole Circuit with him? It is true, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> I did. Nay then the caſe is altered, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> and you have loſt a day of your age indeed. You be <hi>Iohn Primogenitus,</hi> but your brother is <hi>Iohn Senior.</hi> This is ſtrange, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> we kept a moſt exact account of every dayes journey till we came home. Can you ſhew when or where we ſhould loſe a day? You loſt not your day, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> at any one longitude, nor at one time, but by little and little. Anſwer me one queſtion, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> and thereby you ſhall make this clear your ſelf. It is a Problem that <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath, and now is common in uſe. The ſhip <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> in which <hi>Iaſon</hi> ſailed for the golden fleece, when the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was ended, was laid up in the Road for a monument:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118373:17"/>where decaying by little and little, they alwayes pieced it anew where it wore away; till in the end the whole ſubſtance of the old veſſel was gone, and nothing remained thereof, but only the figure, which every where was anſwerable to that of the old. Now tell me whether this ſhip was the very ſame in which <hi>Iaſon</hi> ſailed, or another diverſe from it? and if another, when was it changed? Sure, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> it could not be the ſame ſhip, and it was altered by little and little, and at no time wholly altered till at the laſt. Juſt ſo, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> may I ſay for the day you have loſt, you loſt it not all at one time, but by little &amp; little. Every degree that you went weſtward, you pieced your day, and made it the three hundred and ſixtieth part of a day longer then it was, but therewithal you loſed the three hundred and ſixtieth part of your day in tale; you muſt look to loſe one way if you gain another way. In your travel of the whole round, which is three hundred and ſixty degrees, you gained a whole day in the length of your dayes, but you have loſt thereby a whole day in tale. For tell me, when it was Sunday here at your coming home, what day was it then with you? Indeed, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> it was but Saturday with us, and I wondred much, why we in the count of the dayes of our week came ſtill a day ſhort of what they counted here. But I pray tell me what counſel you will give me in the caſe between me and my brother? why, quoth <hi>Ployden,</hi> be ruled by me and feare not: make one voyage more, and go back the ſame way that you came, and you ſhall certainly finde again the day which you loſt, and then come to me and I will warrant your Caſe. Though now I approve not <hi>Ploydens</hi> judgement in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, yet I ſay, what he told <hi>Iohn</hi> of the lengthening his dayes, and loſing a day in tale at his return, whereby he had not lived ſo many week-dayes as his brother <hi>Iohannes</hi> had by a day, is very true, whether he counted the week by Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or by Meridional days. But yet <hi>Iohn</hi> lived as many Univerſal days as did his brother and loſed not one hour, or minute of an houre of the Vniverſal day; it could neither be lengthened or ſhortened by continual travel. When the Sun came to that Meridian, in which it was, when it began the fifth, ſixth or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, at the firſt Creation, then did the Vniverſal day
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118373:17"/>end, and the next began both with <hi>Iohn</hi> and with his brother, though they were half the Compaſſe of the earth diſtant from each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Week-dayes, whether they be Horizontal or Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, cannot be the ſame in all places; much leſſe can their parts or houres be the ſame. But the Univerſal day is not only the ſame day in all places, but every part or houre of that day is without any variation, the ſame every where</p>
               <p>The laſt day in which Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world, which muſt needs be on two week-dayes with People, if it be on Sunday with ſome, it will be on Saterday or Munday with ſome others; and on different times alſo of the week-day, if it ſhall be at midnight with ſome, (not only mid-night of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 25.6, 13 24.39, 50.</note>, but in reſpect of the week-day) it will be at noon with ſome others, &amp;c. Yet will it be on one and the ſame Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal day, therefore every where in holy Scripture that time is called a day
<note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 6.39.40, 54.11.24. Acts 2.20. Mat. 10.15.</note>, not dayes. It ſhall not be on one day here, and on another day elſewhere, but on one and the ſame day. It wil be a general day of judgement; not only in reſpect of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, but alſo of all places, they ſhal be gather'd from the foure windes
<note n="d" place="margin">Mar. 13.27.</note>, from all quarters of the world. Yea his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhall then be not only on one and the ſame Vniverſal or general day, but on one and the ſame houre of that day in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all People. In an houre of that day the trumpet ſhall ſound
<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 24.36. 1 Theſ. 4.16.</note>, then all in all places ſhall heare the voice thereof at that ſame moment, even at the twinkling of an eye
<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.52.</note>. In vaine ſhall the plea of any be, alledging that it is Tueſday then with ſome people, and it is but Munday with us: O let us tarry till Tueſday too: or that it is but one of the Clock with us, and it is three or more with others, and therefore too ſoon for them. No, for their account of the day will not ſerve the turn. All ſhall finde that houre to be a general houre, of a general or Univerſal day, that is, not ſooner in one place then in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>The difference between Horizontal and Meridional dayes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is not a little difference between the Meridional and the Horizontal day, as may appear by what hath been before ſaid.</p>
               <p>Firſt they differ in length and duration, for the Meridional day, whereby the Jewes counted the dayes of their moneths, and we the dayes of our weeks and moneths, is in time foure and twenty houres without any ſenſible difference. But the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal day, by which the Jewes count the dayes of their weeks, from Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſetting, (or from Sun-riſing to Sun-riſing, by which ſome other have counted the dayes of their week) is ſometimes in ſome places near five and twenty houres; and at ſome other time in the ſame places, it will be but about three and twenty houres in length.</p>
               <p>When I ſay the Horizontal day is the time between Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Sun-ſetting; or between Sun-riſing and Sun-riſing; I mean ſo in all places in and between the temperate zones; and not in places near either of the Poles, where it is continual day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light for many dayes together. From Sun-ſetting to Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in thoſe places cannot properly be termed a day, having in it many revolutions of the Sun, never was it in uſe with any People, to mete out unto them their week, moneth, year or age. Men living in ſuch places meaſure out their weeks and moneths by Meridional dayes as we do. Neither is there any mention made of ſuch dayes any where in ſacred Scripture, and it is of ſuch kinde of dayes as are there mentioned, which I promiſed to ſpeak of
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> chap. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they differ much in reſpect of their beginning and ending. Here in <hi>York</hi> and other places of <hi>England,</hi> there is ſometimes five, ſometimes eight, and never ſo little as three houres difference between their beginnings; and the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their endings. Whence it muſt follow, that every of the week-dayes with the Jewes, conſiſted partly of two dayes of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118373:18"/>their moneth: and that every day of the moneth with them, conſiſted partly of two of their week-dayes; the dayes of their moneth being meridional, and their dayes of the week Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal dayes, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The knowledge hereof is very uſeful for the reconciling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, and reſolving divers doubts in the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, about the Jewes cuſtomes in obſerving their feaſts, as for inſtance, if it be demanded,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the Iſraelites ate the Paſſeover in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and came out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from</hi> Rameſes <hi>on one and the ſame day; Sith it is ſaid, that on the fourteenth day at Even they ate the Paſſeover
<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 12.8.</note>, but it was the next day, being the morrow after,</hi> viz. <hi>the fifteenth day when they came from</hi> Rameſes
<note n="d" place="margin">Num. 33.3.</note>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or whether our Saviour Chriſt ate the Paſſeover with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and after that ſuffered death on the Croſſe on one and the ſame day; Sith it was the fourteenth day at Even when he ate the Paſſeover, and gave then his body and blood Sacramentally, when he inſtituted the Lords Supper, but it was the fifteenth day when he wrought our full Redemption, and actually and really gave his body and blood for us on the Croſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer to both theſe are the ſame. It was on one and the ſame day of their week, but not of their moneth: for it was on the fourteenth day of <hi>Abib</hi> on which the Iſraelites ate the Paſſeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but their going out of <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Rameſes</hi> was on the fifteenth day. So alſo Chriſt are the Paſſeover with his diſciples on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, according to the law of the Paſſeover; but he was crucified on the next day, which was the fifteenth day. <hi>In the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth at Even is the Lords Paſſeover, and on the fifteenth day of the ſame moneth is the Feaſt</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Numb. 28.16, 17. Lev. 23.5, 6.</note> Yet both in one and the ſame day of their week, for the dayes of their week, ever after their freedom from ſlavery, were as I ſhewed before, Horizontal dayes; every of which began at the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting of the former day, at the time they ate the Paſſeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo they were commanded to begin their Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
<note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 23.32.</note>, and therefore ſo alſo did they begin the dayes of their week called the Sabbath, for meting out to them their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-dayes. And herein the Romaniſts do not a little Judaize,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118373:19"/>who continued the like cuſtome of beginning all their ſacred dayes, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> tells us, <hi>In diem feriam,</hi> viz. <hi>decimam quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, &amp;c.

They were done in the ſame day of the moneth, but not in the ſame day of their week. The diſciples demand, the killing and preparing the Paſſeover was all in the fifth day of their week, but their eating it, and <hi>Peters</hi> denial, and the Cocks crowing were done on the ſixth day of their week: Yet all on the fourteenth day of the moneth, and all done on our day of the week which we call Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>

If it be demanded, <hi>How we may conceive it to be on the firſt day of unleavened bread, in which the diſciples asked of Chriſt where they ſhould prepare for him to eate the Paſſeover; Sith the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> Mark <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>do affirm it to be on that day

               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is as before: The firſt day of the week of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread was not then begun, but the firſt day of the moneth of unleavened bread was begun long before. Though there was juſt one week or ſeven dayes of unleavened bread: yet were there eight dayes of the moneth of unleavened bread: On the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, they were commanded to eat unleavened bread, and ſo to the one and twentieth day at even

Thus St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calleth the firſt of thoſe eight days in which they ate unleavened bread, <hi>the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread</hi>

               <p>For the Sabbath-day is proportionable unto the other ſix dayes of the week allowed for labour, every of which hath a night or darkneſſe as well as day-light: and in which night men may as lawfully labour as in the day-light. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> fled by night
<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 2.14.</note>. <hi>The diſciples of Christ rowed by night, and in the fourth watch of the night Ieſus went to them</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 14.25.</note>. Some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are ſo hot, that their chiefeſt work is in the night, and ſo dangerous by reaſon of wilde beaſts, that their chiefeſt care over their flocks is by night. <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care over <hi>Labans</hi> flock was ſuch
<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 31.40.</note> And when Chriſt was borne, an Angel brought the glad tidings thereof to the Shepherds by night as they were watching their flocks
<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 2.8.</note>. If the ſix dayes of labour which God alloweth man be ſuch as have nights as wel as day-lights, then ſuch ought the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of the Lord to be alſo.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Sabbath-day here commanded an Univerſal day, ſuch as was the very day of Gods reſt. For then there would have been an impoſſibility in reſpect of the thing it ſelf,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118373:20"/>for men to keep the ſame, and that for theſe two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is unpoſſible for any man to know within halfe a year, what time of the year it is with us when the firſt yeare of the world began. Some have preſumed to tell the ſame to a day: and in the <hi>Calendar</hi> prefixed to our Church-Bibles and Common-Prayer-books, ſuppoſe it to be the five and twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> and there the ſame day is ſuppoſed to be that in which Chriſt was conceived in the womb of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> which if granted, the thirtieth day of the ſame moneth of <hi>March,</hi> muſt be yearly the day of Gods reſt. For if one be the firſt day of the Creation, the other muſt be the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>Again, let it be, as ſuppoſed ſo granted, that the 25. day of <hi>March</hi> yearly is truly the firſt day of the Creation; yet not a man living is there, that can tell within three days what day of our week that five and twentieth day of <hi>March</hi> was, which was the firſt day of the Creation. All the art and indeavour of man is not ſufficient to find out whether the firſt day of the Creation was Sunday, or Satcrday, or Munday, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not whether the day of Gods reſt was Thurſday, Friday, Saterday, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Let it yet be further granted, that it was Sunday on which the firſt day of the Creation began, and therefore the day of Gods reſt muſt then have his beginning on Saterday; No man can for all that tell within eleven houres at what time of the Sunday the firſt day of the Creation, or at what time of the Saterday the day of Gods reſt began either here, or in <hi>Virginea,</hi> or in <hi>Rome, Ieruſalem,</hi> Paradiſe, or in any other place whatſoever, whether it was at Sun-riſing, Sun-ſetting, Noone, or at the houre of one or two, &amp;c. in the forenoon or afternoon. Wherefore, if by the ſeventh here commanded, had been meant an univerſal day; it muſt be then that ſeventh univerſal day on which God reſted; the which cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by men, becauſe they cannot tell on what day of their week, nor about what time of their day, they ſhould begin the obſervation thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an univerſal day, ſuch as was the day of Gods reſt cannot be obſerved of all the People of God. Though it ſhould be granted, what is of ſome believed, that the day of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118373:20"/>Gods reſt began in Paradiſe on Saterday, and at the riſing of the Sun there; yet all Gods People cannot obſerve that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The earth being global, and the true longitude of the place where Paradiſe was, being unknown, no man can tell when to begin that day in the place where he liveth. We know when it is Saterday in ſome places, it is then Sunday or Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in ſome other places. We know that when Chriſt roſe from the grave, it was then Sunday at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and we know that it was then Saterday in <hi>Virginea</hi> in the afternoon, but no man can knowingly ſay that the day of Gods reſt beginneth on the Saterday, in the forenoon with him, though it be granted that it ſo began in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the day of Gods reſt, (or any other univerſal day) be made known unto men, at what time, and on what day it began in Paradiſe; and the very place where Paradiſe was, be made known alſo: Yet all Gods people could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly keep that very day of Gods reſt; By reaſon of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of longitudes of the places wherein they may live, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep all of them one and the ſame day.</p>
               <p>This hath been proved unto us fully and plainly, even by the oppoſers of the Sabbath. Dr. <hi>Heylyn</hi> hath even demonſtrated the ſame, that men could not poſſibly have kept one and the ſame day for their Sabbath <hi>had it been commanded</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heyl. part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 45, 46, 47, 48.</note>. And further ſheweth, that the Iewes themſelves kept not the very day of Gods reſt
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 125.</note>, though they had one day in ſeven ſet apart for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt and meditation. Mr. <hi>Ironſide</hi> alſo
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ironſ. chaf.</hi> 18. <hi>pag.</hi> 164.</note> from the diverſity of Meridians, proveth that one and the ſame day cannot be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally kept, and therefore never commanded the whole Church. One and the ſame day could not poſſibly be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Sabbath by all the Iewes, in the Eaſt-parts and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts too of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of their diverſity of longitudes. And if it be ſuppoſed to be but two or three degrees difference of longitude; yet will that difference make the dayes as truly to differ from being the ſame, as will an hundred and three, though it will not make them ſo much to differ. The like argument hath Doctor <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis White</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Francis White, <hi>in his of the Sabbath Page</hi> 175.</note>, and divers others. Wherefore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118373:21"/>ſith the univerſal day, ſuch as was the day of Gods reſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be poſſibly kept by all Gods people, no more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet particular day can, it is not the day here commanded by the Lord,</p>
               <p>The Sabbath-day here commanded to be kept holy, is ſuch a kinde of day, as may be known, kept and obſerved by men, whereſoever they inhabit; though in many and divers longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the earth. Such as might have been kept in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe where the law was delivered; and in the Eaſt and Weſt-parts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon, Rome, Spain,</hi> and in all other habitable places, and therefore ought to be either an Horizontal or elſe a Meridional day. In all places of the world, none other but Horizontal or Meridional dayes are now, or at any other time heretofore have been in uſe with men, for meaſuring out unto them their ſeven dayes or week: and ſuch as are their ſix dayes of the week for labour, ſuch ought the ſeventh day, even the day for holy reſt to be alſo. The Sabbath-day with the Iewes was an Horizontal day, but then ſuch were the other days of their week alſo: and what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever have their week to conſiſt of Horizontal dayes, ought to have their Sabbath-day to be ſo alſo. In the North of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> and Queen of <hi>Swedens</hi> Countreys, where the Sun maketh many Revolutions at ſome ſeaſons of the year between his riſing and ſetting, men cannot count their week by Horizontal dayes, but they do and have counted their weeks by Meridional dayes. And ſo do all Chriſtians generally, of what longitude or latitude of the earth ſoever they are of, mete out their weeks by Meridional dayes, then ſuch ought their ſeventh day of their week to be alſo.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118373:21"/>hath plainly pointed out unto us in this law, to be the day following the ſix dayes of labour, ſo that none need to ſay the knowledge hereof is hidden from us, who ſhall aſcend for us into heaven, and bring the knowledge thereof to us, that we may know it and obſerve it? But it is clearly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us by the Lord God, ſo that he that worketh with the Spade, may know the ſame as well as he that handleth the pen. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, and, &amp;c. but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> The ſeventh day, that is, the day following the ſix known dayes of labour, is none of ours, it is the Lords day.</p>
               <p>We may not make the Sabbath-day to be the ſixth day, for then we ſhould ſhew our ſelves unthankful, in not receiving the Lords own bountiful allowance: nor the eighth day, for then we ſhould encroach on the Lords right, and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his liberal allowance of ſix dayes for our ſelves, reſerving only the ſeventh for himſelf, much leſſe ought we to make it the fifth, or the nineth or tenth, or any other then the ſeventh day. Our weeks are not to conſiſt of more or leſſe then ſeven dayes, the laſt day whereof is the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Some call this day the ſtanding day of the week for Gods worſhip, ſome the Lords day, ſome the Sabbath of the Lord, ſome the ſeventh day of the week, and in this law it is ſet out to be the day after our ſix dayes of labour. Though theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations do much differ in letter, ſound and phraſe, yet they all ſignifie the ſame thing; it cannot be the ſeventh day of the week, but it will alſo be the day after our ſix known dayes of labour, and the ſtanding day of the week for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: this is the Lords day, or the Sabbath of the Lord, or to the Lord: and this is not only a ſeventh day of the week, as all and every other of the week-dayes are, but it is the ſeventh day of the week <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>There is not appointed from the Lord by this law any ſet time, whence men ſhould begin their week or ſevening, for to finde the Lords day: ſo that no People, Jew or Gentile are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Commandment, directly to keep their Sabbath, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely on ſuch or ſuch a day; or to begin their Sabbath at any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118373:22"/>ſet particular time; as from midnight, or from Sun-riſing, noon or Sun-ſetting.</p>
               <p>God ſeparated the tenth of grapes, of lambes, of corn, &amp;c to the uſe of the Prieſts and Levites. As the ſeventh day is in this Commandment ſaid to be the Lords, and ſanctified by the Lord, ſo were thoſe tenths ſaid to be the Lords, and ſanctified or holy to the Lord. But it cannot there be meant of the very tenth Lambe that fell in order from the Damme, or of the tenth eare of corn, or of the tenth cluſter of grapes, firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing or grown ripe; this was too too difficult for to finde out; but of the tenth in proportion ſucceſſively, according to the cuſtomary manner of their tithing in the places where they lived. No more can it be meant here of the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Creation, which cannot be found out, nor from any particular time ſet by the Lord, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day in proportion ſucceſſively, according as any Nation or people do cuſtomarily begin their week, in what longitude of the earth ſoever they do inhabit: that ſeventh day by the expreſſe words of this law is the Lords day, or Sabbath-day to or for the Lord, not of the Lord in that ſenſe which ſome take it, as if it were the very day of Gods reſt, but the 7th day unto the Lord, that is, ſacred or holy to or for the Lord: ſo do the very words of the text import, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

As we ſay in tithing of corne, whereſoever men by agreement do begin to tithe, that nine cocks or ſtacks of corn are the Farmers, but the tenth is the Parſons, or is due to the Parſon: So in ſevening out our dayes, at what time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to mens cuſtome they begin their week or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118373:22"/>ſevening; ſix days are ours but the ſeventh day is the Lords, it is his due, and not our own. God hath not bound men by this law to any ſet time, when to begin their week, either at the Sun-ſetting as the Jews began their week; or at midnight as Chriſtians begin theirs, or at any other ſet time, but in every Nation, however they begin their week, the ſeventh day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the Lords.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the Jewes had a ſet time when they ſhould begin their week or ſevening; and ſo had a ſet and peculiar time or day on which they were to keep their Sabbath: but this they were not bound unto by this law. That Saterday was their ſeventh or ſacred day, and that it began at Sun-ſetting, rather then at another time, was not by any expreſſe out of this Commandment, but accidentally: that thereby they might be the better taken off from the Aſſyrians idolatry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they and generally moſt Nations, were deeply infected; of which I will ſpeak more particularly in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>This was the firſt idol that ever we could reade of to be worſhipped in a Temple. <hi>Aſſyria</hi> becoming a great Monarchy, other Nations either for feare or favour had this <hi>Belus</hi> alſo for their Protector too, calling it according to their ſeveral languages,

               <p>The other maine idolatry ſet up by the power of the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,, trough the help of their Chaldees was the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Hoſt of heaven, that is the Sun and Moon, and the reſt of the Planets.</p>
               <p>The skilful in Aſtronomy and Aſtrology do unanimouſly teſtifie of the Fathers and Patriarchs before the flood, that they were the firſt Founders and excellently skilful in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or Aſtronomy; and this may witneſſe the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes which they built, the one of brick, the other of ſtone, in which were engraven the principles thereof; that Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties after the flood may be skill'd alſo in the knowledge of the heavens and motion of the ſtars as well as they: one where of remained in <hi>Syria</hi> in the time of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> as he himſelf rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118373:24"/>worſhipping the Hoſt of heaven, was long before the flood, and that men called then the week-dayes by the names of the Planets, as now men do.

Though he lived not unto <hi>Moſes</hi> dayes, yet did he live till <hi>Abraham</hi> was an old man, if ſo he lived not after <hi>Abraham</hi> was buried: and this idolatry of worſhipping the Hoſt of Heaven, was before that ſet up by the Aſſyrians and their Chaldees.</p>

As Saint-worſhippers do call the dayes of the moneth, on which they give ſpecial worſhip to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> St. <hi>Iames;</hi> St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, St. <hi>Iohns</hi> day, and St. <hi>James</hi> day.

               <p>They gave not equal honour unto the Planets, neither were the dayes of their week alike ſacred; but they had the Sun in the greateſt honour, and for their moſt high God; next to him

               <p>Firſt, for that the Romiſh Church when they had got ſome power into their hands, and did in Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth his dayes ſuppreſſe the Idolatries of the Heathen, who worſhipped their Idols in the Temple at Rome, which was dedicated to all the gods, and then called <hi>Pantheon;</hi> and having inſtead thereof ſet up another kinde of worſhip like unto that, even of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and All Saints; whereupon that day was by that Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> made an holy day, <hi>called by the Name of All-Saints day,</hi> and the Temple al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and All Saints, called thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth <hi>Eccleſia Beatae Mariae rotunda</hi>

I will deliver the words of an old Chronologer hereof. <hi>Iſte</hi> Bonifacius <hi>(ſcilicet Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus) conſecravit</hi> Pantheon, <hi>(id eſt) Templum omnium Deorum, ubi Chriſtiani periclitabantur à Daemonibus. Et eſt pulchra ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudo, quomdo Spiritus Sanctus, ex malis inſtitut is Paganorum ſcit eligere Sanctum exercitium devotionis, quaſi medicina fiat ex veneno. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bienim impii colebant Daemones, ibi Chriſtiani colunt omnes Sanctos: ſic ars deluditur arte</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Faſcicu. tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potum.</note>. And a little after; <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum omnium Sanctorum inſtitur à</hi> Bonifacio <hi>quarto.</hi> Then at that time I ſuppoſe were the images of the Saints placed up on high in their roode, which common people here with us call their rood-loft, in imitation of the Heathen. For commonly when the Romiſh Church put down any idolatrous cuſtom of the Heathen, then they ſet up another reſembling that which they put down; and this did they either for avoiding the greater ſcandal of the Heathen, which were then potent; or to winne them the better by degrees to Chriſtian Religion or for ſome other by-reſpect.</p>
               <p>As the Heathen had ſome one or other particular Planet or Idol, to be the Patron and Protector of ſome one people or other, and ſo many Protectors as there were nations: <hi>Belus</hi> for <hi>Aſſyria; Diana</hi> for <hi>Epheſus; Jupiter</hi> for <hi>Rome; Juno</hi> for <hi>Samos; Bacchus</hi> for <hi>Thebes, &amp;c.</hi> So when that idolatry was ſuppreſt, in ſtead of theſe idols, the Romane Church had holy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118373:26"/>Saints to be invocated; and had for Protectors in like manner. Thus was St <hi>James</hi> for <hi>Spaine,</hi> St. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> for <hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> As the heathen idolaters had for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions, ſeveral gods and goddeſſes on whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for help; <hi>Bellona</hi> in time of warre; <hi>Cunina</hi> for infants; <hi>Segetia</hi> for ſtanding corne; <hi>Forculus</hi> to keep the doors

So the Romane Church to winne the heathens by degrees, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to continue in idolatry ſtill: but inſtead of their Demi-gods, they ſhould invocate Saints: St. <hi>Rumbal</hi> for the tooth-ache; St. <hi>Petronel</hi> for the ague; St. <hi>Loye</hi> for horſes; St. <hi>Anthony</hi> for pigs: St. <hi>Gregory</hi> for Schollers; St. <hi>George</hi> for ſouldiers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What were the Monks and Friars, the chaſte ſhavelings and holy Nunnes, but the natural ſucceſſors of <hi>Berecynthia's</hi> and <hi>Veſta's</hi> Prieſts and Virgins? <hi>Rome</hi> heathen had two god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes in ſpecial reverence <hi>Berecynthia</hi> and <hi>Veſta; Berecynthia</hi> they held to be the mother of the gods

               <p>Now I ſay, theſe and other the like practices of the Roman Church, in putting down the idolatrous cuſtomes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118373:26"/>idolaters, and ſetting up ſuch of their own near alike, and reſembling them, make me to conceive, that the idols which the Heathen worſhipped in their Temple <hi>Pantheon,</hi> and in other their Temples were placed aloft in a rowe or rank, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I ſhewed before; for that the images of the Saints, which the Romane Church erected to be worſhipped in ſtead of the other, were ſo ſet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> telleth us, the learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors expound theſe words of <hi>Ezechiel, And lo they put the branch to their noſe

                        <hi>Lyra. in Ezec. c.</hi> 8.17.</note>; thus; their idols were lifted up aloft, therefore the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters reached up rods or branches to touch them; and after that, they put their rods or branches to their mouths or noſes, in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their idols.</hi> Had not their idols been placed aloft in manner as the images of the Saints afterwards were, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe Doctors would not have given ſuch an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that text. The placing of the idols of the heathen in ſuch manner as is before ſaid, I confeſſe is my opinion, and for the reaſons before given, which if they ſeem weak to any, I leave the ſame to his better judgement, not willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt any herein, being not a matter of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But that the planets were the proper gods of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans and Aſſyrians of old time, and that the dayes of the week were firſt ſo called by the Chaldeans, according to the names of the Planets, which they worſhipped and had for their gods, as I before ſaid, is not mine opinion only, but learned men have teſtified as much. And People as they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and planted themſelves the nearer to <hi>Chaldea</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria,</hi> the more did they either for feare or favour, imitate them in their idolatries; inſomuch that among the Perſians none were to be honoured as Kings unleſſe they were Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

They all were worſhippers of the Hoſt of heaven gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: and called the dayes of the week by the names of the Planets, as the Chaldees did.</p>
               <p>And as the Chaldees had the Sunne and Moon in more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honour then the other planets ſo had other Nations alſo.

Wherefore, as Papiſts ſay, that in worſhipping <hi>Peter, Iames, Magdalene,</hi> and the reſt of the Saints on their dayes, they worſhip Chriſt in them, Chriſt in his Saints: So the Sun-worſhippers thought, that in honouring the Commiſſioners and chiefeſt Officers of the Sun, they honoured the Sun, who was the Lord of them all. And therefore when they worſhipped any one of theſe planets on his day, they regarded not whether the planet was before them or behinde their backs, or over them or under them, or in what Meridian ſoever it was, but alwayes worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Eaſtward towards the Sun-riſing

               <p>THe Iſraelites living in <hi>Egypt</hi> were deeply tainted with the aforeſaid Aſſyrian Idolatries which the Egyptians from them had learnt and ſet up. Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> proveth out of <hi>Cyril</hi> that the Jews worſhipped the Sun and Moon, and Hoſt of heaven, as in thoſe times the Egyptians did. And to the end they mght acknowledge God alone to be the Creatour; their Sabbath-day was ſet unto them, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>It is very true indeed what Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith of them touching their Idolatries. Inſomuch, that when the Lord brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be a peculiar people to himſelf, God then uſed many means to draw them off from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Sun, Moon, and the reſt of the Planets, all called the Hoſt of heaven, whereof the Sun was the chief.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God gave them a ſpecial charge that thenceforth not any of them ſhould ſerve the Sun, or Moon, &amp;c. And that if any man or woman among them ſhould be known to ſerve the Sun, or Moon, or any of the Hoſt of heaven, then the party, whether man or woman was to be ſtoned to death without mercy
<note n="b" place="margin">De t. 17.2, 3, 4, 5.</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God charged them not to ſpeak of thoſe gods, or to have their names come out of any of their mouths
<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 23.13.</note>. They might not call the dayes of the week by the names of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, the day of the Sun, the day of the Moon, &amp;c. as other Nations did, and do for the moſt part: but they called them thenceforth <hi>the firſt of the Sabbath, the ſecond of the Sabbath, &amp;c.</hi> Inſomuch that all the Evangeliſts in recording the day and time of our Saviours Reſurrection, ſay not, <hi>In the morning of the day of the Sun,</hi> as other Nations commonly called that time, and we now, <hi>In the Sunday-morning;</hi> but <hi>In the morning of the firſt day of the Sabbath:</hi> ſo did they call our Sunday. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, though he wrote to the Church in <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet writing in the behalf of ſomes Jews in <hi>Judea</hi> that were in want, called their weekly meeting day, not the day of the Sun,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118373:30"/>as the Gentiles cal'd that day, but the firſt day of the Sabbath
<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 16.2.</note>, being the proper name thereof with the Jewes.</p>
               <p>It is true, that Saint <hi>John</hi> (though he was a Jew, yet writing not to the Jews, but to the Gentiles lately converted
<note n="c" place="margin">Diod. in loe.</note>, that is, to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 1.4.</note>) called <hi>our Sunday,</hi> not by the name of the day of the Sun as the Gentiles called it, nor by the name of the <hi>firſt day of the Sabbath,</hi> as he and the Jews com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called it, but he called it <hi>The Lords day. John</hi> called it not the day of the Sun, for he was a Jew; nor did he call it <hi>the firſt day of the Sabbath,</hi> for that he wrote to the Gentiles, to whom the name of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was odious, as was the name <hi>of the day of the Sun</hi> to the Jews; and we finde not that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who deſcended of the Gentiles, did in many yeers after this uſe the name of Sabbath in their writings: nor did the Jews uſe the name of <hi>the day of the Sun</hi> in theirs. But <hi>Iohn</hi> called it the <hi>Lords day,</hi> being as truly the Lords day with the Churches of the Gentiles, as was the Saterday with the Jews.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord cauſed them to alter their times which were meaſured out to them by the courſe of the Sun, as years, moneths, weeks and dayes. Whereas their year before began in <hi>Tiſri,</hi> when the Sun was in the Autumnal Equinox; they muſt thenceforth begin the ſame, when the Sun is moſt remote from it, that is, in <hi>Abib. Abib</hi> now muſt be their firſt moneth, and <hi>Tiſri</hi> their ſeventh, which was their firſt before
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> chap. 4.</note>. Their weeks were then wholly altered: the day of the Sun, which was the Gentiles ſeventh ſacred day (as I ſhall ſhew anon
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> chap. 15.</note>) muſt thenceforth be with them a common or ordinary work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and the day which they muſt have for their ſeventh ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred day, was thenceforth to be that day, which the Lord pointed out unto them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, the day following their ſix dayes of gathering Quailes and Manna
<note n="g" place="margin">Ex. 16.23, 26</note>, when they were ready to periſh through want of food. Alſo to draw the people unto an awful obedience hereto, and that they might not think it to be an innovation raiſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then generally thought it to be

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118373:30"/>the day before, and kept unto their Sabbath-day ſtanck not. The miraculous feeding them many years after this maner bred in them a cuſtome of obſerving the week according to this new aſſignment. The Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> cauſed them to alter the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their dayes of the week too, for wheras before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their dayes, as other worſhippers of the Sun did, at the firſt appearance of the Sun in the Horizon, counting the firſt houre of their day to begin at Sun riſing, thenceforth they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their day for the ſervice of God, when the Sun is furtheſt off from his riſing. Sun-riſing was the time when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles began their worſhip to the Sun, but theirs muſt begin at Sun-ſetting. Their evening ſacrifice, was their prime ſacrifice
<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 141.2.</note>. Their Feaſt of the Paſſeover muſt be at the ſetting of the Sun
<note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 16.6.</note>, and their Sabbaths muſt begin with the evening; from even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evening were they to celebrate their Sabbaths
<note n="f" place="margin">Lev. 23.32.</note>, that ſo they may the better remember and acknowledge the Lord God their Creator and Governour; that it was he and not the Sun, Moon or Hoſt of heaven, that wrought their great deliverance in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, to bring the Iſraelites into the greater diſlike and deteſtation of worſhipping the Sun towards the Eaſt, as the Nations did, the Lord would that they ſhould turn their breech or back-parts toward the Sun-riſing when they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him. The idolatrous Nations in thoſe dayes, when they worſhipped the Sun, Moon, or any of the Hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, bowed towards the Eaſt, that is, towards the Sun-riſing in honour of the Sun; but now in contempt of that idolatry the Jewes were to have their faces toward the Weſt or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting; and their breech toward the Sun-riſing, when they bowed and worſhipped God. The holy place therefore in the Tabernacle was toward the Weſt, as Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> proveth
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Willet. Syn. Con.</hi> 9.</note>. And when the Temple of God was built, the houſe of God was ſo placed in the inner Court, as that they who came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray, when they bowed had their Poſteriours, (as it is in the Hebrew) towards the Sun-riſing, and their faces Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the houſe of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, the day of the Sun muſt no longer be their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth ſacred day. The having that day ſacred might have nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118373:31"/>them in, or have drawn them again to the ſaid idolatry of worſhipping the Sun; but that they might be taken wholly off from it, the day of the Sun was to be with them common or prophane, and another day, the day before the day of the Sun, even that which was the ſeventh from their firſt gathering Quailes and Manna

               <p>Yet all theſe courſes which the moſt wiſe God took with them prevailed not, they would not be reclaimed from their idolatry, they were reſolved to uphold their wicked cuſtom; not only the meaner ſort but <hi>the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Princes, the Prieſts and wicked Prophets, loved, ſought, ſerved, worſhipped, and walked after the Sun, Moon

Yet could he not root out this monſtrous abomination of worſhipping the Sun, but they ſtrengthened themſelves therin, inſomuch that even in the Temple of God, in the place where they ſhould worſhip the Lord of Glory, with their faces Weſtward towards the houſe of God, they would in a moſt high contempt worſhip the Sun; and bow with their breech towards the houſe of God, having their faces towards the Sun-riſing; Of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Lord complaineth to his Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> to whom he ſhewed their great abominations, and greater, yea and greater then thoſe; at length he ſhewed him this which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all the other. <hi>Turn thee again,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and thou ſhalt ſee greater abominations then theſe, and he brought me into the inner Court of the Lords houſe, and behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the Porch and the Altar were about five and twenty men, with their Poſteriors toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the Eaſt: and they worſhipped the Sun towards the Eaſt</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Ezecb. 8.15, 16.</note>. The women were reſolute to worſhip the Moon too, after the manner of the Heathen. <hi>We will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do,</hi> ſaid they

The reaſon he gives for it, is, for that <hi>If the Moon did nothing help the ſecond cauſes in generation, yet in the bringing forth it is evident; for this is moſt certain, though every Midwife hath not obſerved ſo much, that the most eaſie delivery a woman can have, is alwayes in the increaſe toward and in the full of the Moon, and the hardeſt labours in the new and ſilent Moon; which was the reaſon that the Midwives heretofore,</hi> (he meaneth among the Jewes as well as the Heathen) <hi>did alwayes in ſuch a Caſe implore the aide of that Planet, for the ſafe and eaſie delivery of their infants; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof you may have, one among many in the Comedy

The Prophet</hi> Jeremy <hi>maketh mention of this worſhip in the ſeventh Chapter, where he calleth the Moon the Queen of Heaven, as our Engliſh Tranſlation hath very well rendred. The reaſon which he giveth why the women cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the Moon at ſuch times, I omit here to relate, being the ſame which Phyſicians commonly do give. The Prophet addeth that the women made Cakes to this Queen. This Cuſtom of offering Cakes to the Moon, our Anceſtors may ſeem not to have been ignorant of; to this day our women make Cakes at ſuch times, yea the childe it ſelf is no ſooner born, but 'tis baptized into the names of theſe Cakes, for ſo the women call their Babes Cake-bread.</hi> So much <hi>John Gregory,</hi> and more.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook the Covenant of their God, and went a whoring after the gods of the Nations, chiefly after the Sun:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118373:32"/>yet the Lord was not wanting, in affording the many means aforeſaid for reclaiming them, where of this was not the leaſt, in that he took them off from the memory of the day of the Sun, and aſſigned unto them the Saterday for their Sabbath. Concerning which we may truly ſay, that as their Sabbath-day was their ſeventh day from their firſt gathering Quailes and Manna, and as it was to begin at Sun-ſetting (which <hi>Moſes</hi> termed the ſeaſon that they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Deut, 16.6</note>) ſo was it Ceremonial; a ſigne and token whereby they were known to be Gods peculiar people
<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 31.13.</note>, and diſtinguiſhed from all Nations that adored the Sun. Unto the obſervation of which ſeventh day, from their firſt labouring for Manna were they bound, and none but they; and they no longer then till the coming of him, of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> their Captain ſaid, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear
<note n="d" place="margin">Acts 7.37.</note>: Even Ieſus Chriſt who is the Captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 2.10.</note>: who is greater then <hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought us out of a greater bondage then <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Iſraelites, and who gave us not Quailes and Manna, but his own fleſh; he gave us the true bread that came down from heaven, that we might live through him. After whoſe coming, as all other ſhadows and Ceremonies, ſo this of their Saterday. Sabbath from Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Sun-ſetting did vaniſh alſo. The day of Saturn was thenceforth no more holy then the day of the Sun. The Jewes might as lawfully, with their general conſent, have kept the Sabbath on the Sunday as on the Saterday. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice taught Chriſtians then, that difference of dayes was taken away. <hi>

<note n="b" place="margin">Acts 17.2. and 18.4. and 13.14, 42.</note>. But when he was with the Gentiles that were turned unto Chriſt, and imbraced the Goſpel, he obſerved and kept the ſame ſeventh ſacred day they did, which with them was called the day of the Sun, on which day they uſually met together
<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 16.2. Acts 20.7.</note>. There aroſe no ſmall difference between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jewes, and the converted Gentiles hereabout. The Jewes eſteeming the Saterday to be more holy then the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, condemned the Gentiles for Prophaners of the Sabbath, becauſe they obſerved not the Saterday: and for that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118373:32"/>kept the day of the Sun, the Jewes held them to be Worſhippers of the Sun as other Gentiſes were. The Gentiles on the other ſide upbraided the Jewes as ſuperſtitious, for their obſerving their ſet holy-dayes, (whereof their Saterday-Sabbath from evening to evening was one) which were aboliſhed.

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>The Opinion of ſome concerning weeks. How it's hatched from the earths ſuppoſed plainneſſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT hath been the general Opinion, not only of the vulgar, but of the learned alſo, that the ſeventh day commanded us in this law, hath relation only to the ſix work-dayes of the Lord God, and not to the ſix work-dayes with men, as if the meaning of theſe words of the Commandment, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord thy God,</hi> (ſo it is in the Hebrew) ſhould be thus. The ſix dayes in which I wrought when I created all things, ſhall be thy ſix work-dayes, in them thou ſhalt do all thy work, but the ſeventh day wherein I reſted thou ſhalt reſt, and do none of thy works on any part of that day; but ſhalt keep that day holy, it is the day of my reſt.</p>
               <p>From hence they wil have a week to be none other with any people, but ſeven ſuch dayes, whereof the ſix former dayes be the ſame with the firſt ſix dayes of the Creation, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth be the ſame with the day of Gods reſt. Weeks in uſe with the Jewes they held to be ſuch; the firſt ſix dayes of their week, to be the ſame with the ſix dayes on which God wrought; and their ſeventh day, which was from Friday at the ſetting of the Sun to Saterdays Sun-ſetting, to be the very day of Gods reſt. Though Sunday be the day following the ſix dayes of labour with us, and on which we reſt from our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, having wrought ſix dayes before, yet we do not reſt on the ſeventh day (as they ſay) according to Gods example; but on the firſt day: from Sunday to Sunday they will not have to be a week, but from Saterday to Saterday only.</p>
               <p>And from hence do they, who deny the Morality of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath teach and write, that the boundary or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the week muſt be the day of Gods reſt; and that the day of Gods reſt was the very day which God bleſſed and ſanctified, and in this law commanded to be kept holy, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118373:33"/>that the Jewes Sabbath only was the ſeventh-day Sabbath, which in this law is commanded to be obſerved holy; and that the Jewes Sabbath-day being Ceremonial, and aboliſhed by the coming of the Meſſias, the ſeventh-day Sabbath in this law expreſly commanded to be ſanctified, is aboliſhed alſo, and not to be obſerved by Chriſtians; and that ſith no other ſet day is inſtituted in ſtead thereof by any divine authority, it reſteth in the boſome of the Church or Magiſtrates, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what day they pleaſe for Gods publick worſhip.</p>
               <p>Though all and every of theſe be very falſe, yet are they all by theſe men held to be even as true as their Creed; they little conſidering from how unſound and rotten a root, theſe and every of them have had their firſt ſpring, and that is from a ſuppoſal that the earth is plain and not round.</p>
               <p>It is an odde, but an old conceit of ſome Philoſophers, which afterward was held and maintained by the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the earth was not round, but plain as a Champion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. They thought there could be no dwellers under the earth which go foot to foot againſt us: and that if there ſhould be any Antipodes imagined, yet them not to be <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, whom they held to have all dwelt upon the earth, and to have been all drowned except eight perſons, when <hi>Noahs</hi> flood covered all the face of the earth. So ſtrong did this opinion prevail with the ſaid Fathers, as that whoever held the contrary, was counted near as bad as an Heretick. Witneſſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Virgilius,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by <hi>Boniface</hi> unto <hi>Zachary</hi> then Pope, and was degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for holding that there were Antipodes, and that they had a Sun and Moon to ſhine unto them as well as to us. This ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be ſeen in <hi>Aventine</hi>

                     <hi>Aven. Annal. Bar. l.</hi> 3.</note>, and in <hi>Baronius,</hi> who ſought to cover the fact with fig-leaves.</p>
               <p>Now that the adverſaries to the Morality of this law held all thoſe tenents before-ſaid, and that they all ſprang from this errour of the earths ſuppoſed plain ſuperficies, I will next ſhew. For the clearing whereof I need not cite many of them, one may ſerve for all, being approved by them all. Neither will I tell here all that he writes hereabout, but that which chiefly concernes the point in hand.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:118373:34"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ironſide</hi> a Reverend Divine, and of ſingular gifts and parts, but over-ſwayed by the ſtream of late times, doth in his book called the <hi>Seven Queſtions of the Sabbath,</hi> dedicated to the late Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, William Laud,</hi> tell us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is neceſſary, not only for the learned, but alſo for the weak and inferiour ſort of people, to know to a minute when the Lords day or Sabbath doth begin, and when it doth end, and that for two ſpecial reaſons. The one is for the Peace and quiet of their conſciences, which elſe would be wounded and diſquieted. The other is, for that unleſſe the very day and the whole day be kept to a Minute, all the duties done on that day are loſt. His words are theſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>It is neceſſary to inquire of the dimenſions of this day, of what duration and continuance of time it muſt be

Amongſt thoſe things which diſquiet and perplex the Conſciences of the weak, concerning the Lords day, this is not the leaſt, where it is to begin, and how long it laſteth. For God requiring of us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and intire obedience, without diminution or defalcation; unleſſe every minute of time, which the Lord requireth of us as his tribute and homage, be duly tendred to him; our whole labour beſtowed upon the parts and pieces of the day is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 126.</note>. It is alſo that which concerns the moſt ſort of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour People to be ſatisfied in, leſt the Commandment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring one thing, their employments another, they many times wound their conſciences, and rob themſelves of that Peace, which otherwiſe they might enjoy</hi>

               <p n="2">2ly, that God might have his due tribute, and the weak (if they will) may keep their conſciences quiet in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the true and full time of the Sabbath, he ſetteth down the preciſe day of the Sabbath (as he conceiveth) and the exact time to a minute when the Sabbath-day is to begin. As for the day, he tells us that the Sabbath-day, muſt be preciſely the day of Gods reſt. Thus</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Aſſoon as God had ended his work, he ordained and appointed, that the ſeventh day, the day of his own reſt,</hi> (elſe he will not conceive that it can be the ſeventh day) <hi>ſhould be that on which the Church ſhould reſt

               <p>As for the exact time when the Sabbath is to begin and end, he tells us, that the very minute in which the Sun is in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon at his riſing, is the true beginning of the day, and he proveth that it muſt ſo be, for that when the fourth day at the Creation began, the Sun was then in the Horizon at his riſing, ſo that any of the inferiour ſort of people, he before ſpake of, may by looking in his Almanack, tell to a minute (if Mr. <hi>Ironſides</hi> rule faile him not) at any time throughout all the year, and in any place through out the world, when the 4th day of the Creation, and the very day of Gods reſt, and ſo conſequently when the Sabbath beginneth. Theſe are his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the natural day be meaſured by the Revolution of the Sunne, as all confeſſe, ſure it is that until the Sun begin his courſe, the day cannot begin. At what time now did the Sun ſet forth, upon the fourth day at the Creation? Common reaſon will ſay, when he firſt appeared in the Horizon. The riſing therefore of the Sun in the Horizon, muſt needs be the firſt Period of the natural day</hi>

               <p n="3">3ly, he tels us that the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath-day was the day of Gods reſt; and the ſame with that which God bleſſed &amp; ſanctified, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no difference between all theſe three. His words are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That particular Sabbath-day given unto the</hi> Jews, <hi>even the day of Gods reſt, is not a Sabbath, but the Sabbath, even that which God ſanctifyed. The Sabbath must be the ſame with the ſeventh, or elſe there is no tolerable ſenſe, or congruity in that law</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 70.</note>. Whereas he ſaith, the ſame with the 7th, he meaneth by the 7th, the 7th day from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, even the very day of Gods reſt, which he proved to begin at the riſing of the Sun like as the 4th day did.</p>
               <p>Now whereas ſome may, and that not without juſt cauſe, doubt how the day of Gods reſt which began at Sun-riſing (as he ſaith) and the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, which ever began at the ſetting of the Sun wherſoever they dwelt, could be one and the ſame day: Sith that they, as well in reſpect of their beginnings, as alſo in reſpect of their endings are heavenly wide the one from the other: even as farre as the Sun-riſing is diſtant from Sun-ſetting; between both which there muſt be half

If at the Sun-riſing before, that is on the Friday morning; then the Turks Sabbath (ſo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Heylin</hi> calleth it) may more truly be called the day of Gods reſt,

                     <hi>Heyl. part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 48.</note> then that of the Jews: But if at the Sun-riſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then our Chriſtian Sabbath-day ever began on the day of Gods reſt, the which the Jews Sabbath never did.</p>
               <p>For the wiping off this, and all ſuch doubts, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ironſide</hi> tells us both at what time, and alſo by what means the day of Gods reſt and the Jews Sabbath was made to be one and the ſame day; which were alwayes two before. His words are.</p>
               <q>When God commanded the Jews their Sabbaths from even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evening, the order of the natural day was inverted by him; not ſo much looking to the number of four &amp; twenty hours, as to the time of Iſraels deliverance out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which began when the Paſſeover was eaten at even
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iron. pa.</hi> 138.</note>, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>His meaning in theſe his Words may be conceived to be this: When God commanded the Jews, after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to keep their Sabbath on the Saterday, and to begin the ſame at the Sun-ſetting of the day before-going, that is on the Friday at the ſetting of the Sunne, God miraculouſly at an inſtant turned the Eaſt into the Weſt, and ſo the place of Sun-riſing came unto the place of Sun-ſetting ſo cloſe, as that they kiſſed each other, as he ſaith, <hi>the end of one contiguum is the beginning of the other.</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iron. pa.</hi> 138.</note> If ſuch ſhould not be his meaning; it is not to be conceived how he ſhould make Sun-riſing, and Sun-ſetting, or the day of Gods reſt, which he ſaith, began at Sun-riſing, and the Jews Sabbath, which began at Sun-ſetting, to be one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; he tells us that the obſervation of the Sabbath is abrogated; this errour is ſtrong with him, becauſe the Jews Sabbath-day is abrogated; he thinking no difference to be made between the Jews Sabbath-day, and the Sabbath-day here in this Law commanded to be kept holy; whereas they differ, as doeth the <hi>ſpecies</hi> from its <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> And from hence he inferreth that it wholly reſteth in the power of the Church, and Magiſtrates to appoint the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118373:35"/>time for Gods publique worſhip. His words are theſe.</p>
               <q>The Obſervation of that Sabbath which is pretended to have been commanded Adam in Paradiſe, is abrogated by Chriſt, as he is the Meſſias, even that day, on which God reſted; and which he ſanctified

               <p>A Week is the ſpace of time made by ſeven whole dayes without intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>By ſeven dayes, I mean ſeven ſuch dayes as are all of one and the ſame kinde. If any of them be horizontall dayes, they are all to be horizontal dayes, ſuch as were the ſeven dayes of the Week with the Jews. And if any be meridional, they are all to be meridional dayes, as are the dayes of the week with Chriſtians. The Jews Sabbath, or ſeventg day was from Sun-fettinh to Sun-ſetting; therefore ſo ſhould the ſix dayes of their week be alſo.

               <p>Firſt, from the ſeveral names and appellations by which a week is called with people of ſeveral tongues and languages. Our ancient Saxons, &amp; we from them call it Sennight; and two ſuch weeks fortnight; that is ſeven nights, and fourteen nights. The Romans called it <hi>Septimana;</hi> that is, ſeven mornings, taking the morning for the whole day, as the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did the night. With the Greeks it was called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, which is defined to be <hi>Intervallum ſeptem dierum:</hi> That is, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes. The Hebrews called a week not ſeven nights, as the Saxons did, nor ſeven mornings, as the Romans did, but as the Greeks did <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeven dayes, or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, a ſeveny of dayes</p>
               <p>Secondly, frequently in holy Scripture, ſeven dayes from any ſet time is counted a week. <hi>Laban</hi> bade <hi>Jacob fulfill her week</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gen 23.27.</note>: meaning the ſeven dayes of <hi>Leas</hi> marriage: Such was the uſual time for marriage-feaſts in thoſe dayes
<note n="c" place="margin">Iudg. 14.10, 12.</note>. If a woman was at any time delivered of a man-child ſhe was to be unclean ſeven dayes; or a week: but if ſhe was delivered of a maid-childe
<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 12 2, 5.</note>, ſhe was to be unclean <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, two weeks: And ſo is it in our laſt Tranſlation. The Lord appointed the Jews to count for their feaſt of Pentecoſt called their feaſt of weeks, thus. <hi>On the morrow after the feaſt-day of the Paſſeover</hi> (which never fell on the ſame day of the week two years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) ſhalt thou number unto thee ſeven weeks
<note n="f" place="margin">Levit. 23.11, 15, 16. Deut. 16.9.</note>. So that it is evident, that theſe their weeks for meting out unto them their feaſt of Pentecoſt, began from different times, or dayes of their Sabbatical week.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:118373:38"/>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeven dayes ſo ſucceeding each other, as that their boundary be the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> every indifferent man wil grant to be a week. But ſuch may be from any ſet time, or day. Such were the ſeven dayes of unleavend bread: they began ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on Munday, ſometimes on Tueſday, and ſometimes on other dayes, and never two years together on one and the ſame day of the Jews Sabbatical week. Yet were thoſe ſeven dayes a week with them, even their week of Sweet Bread; the boundary whereof was the <hi>ſeventh day</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 23.8. Deut. 16.8. Exod. 12.16.</note>. There is no difference made either in reſpect of letters, vowels, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents between the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> of the week of ſweet bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-ſaid, and the ſeventh day of their Sabbatical week, which with them was the Sabbath-day of the Lord. The like is to be ſaid of the weeks appointed to their Prieſts for their judgement in the caſe of Leproſie
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 13.5, 27.</note>. And of the weeks of <hi>Daniels</hi> mourning
<note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 10.2, 3.</note>. By all which it is clear that a week is ſeven dayes ſucceeding each other from any ſet time, or day: and that if the firſt day thereof be known, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the ſame will be known alſo.</p>
               <p>Next, we are to know what the ſeventh day of the week is, being the day here in this Law commanded to be kept holy.</p>
               <p>There is much difference between a ſeventh day and the ſeventh day. Every day of a week is a ſeventh day; but only the boundary thereof is the ſeventh day of that week. In like manner, there is much difference between the ſeventh day of a week, and the ſeventh day of the week. The ſeventh day from the birth of a childe is the ſeventh day of a week, and the boundary thereof; then was the childe a week old. The laſt day of the week of unleavened-bread was the ſeventh day of a week; and ſo was the ſeventh day appointed to the Prieſt in the caſe of Leproſie, as before was ſhewed; but it was not the ſeventh day of the week, of the week whoſe boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary is ſacred, and commanded to be kept holy. This week is the week <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it hath ſome excellency in it, which other weeks have not: and that in reſpect of its uſe, conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and univerſality.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is more excellent then other-weeks, in regard of its excellent uſe; which is to meaſure out to men what dayes are

But the ſeventh-day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> God by this Law tyeth no nation to a ſet houre, or time when to begin their week: nor by what names they ſhould call the dayes of their week. But he tyeth all Nations that at what time ſoever they begin the week, they work not on the ſeventh day, but ſanctifie it: It is the Lords. All other weeks are for uſe inferiour to this. Other weeks may ſerve for to ſhew the juſt time for payments of monies, weekly or moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly billetting of ſouldiers, taking of journeys, and for a thouſand other reckonings in Civil affairs, but all inferiour in uſe unto this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, other weeks are more inconſtant then this, they vary in one and the ſame place, or elſe continue but a ſhort time. The weeks of Sweet bread varied every yeare with the Jewes, like as their Paſſeover did, which never fell on the ſame week-day two yeares together, but were as unconſtant as the Moon. Weeks for payments of moneys, billeting ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, &amp;c. are of ſhort continuance. Of thoſe that do uſe them, ſeldom or never do all of the ſame City or Town begin them at the ſame time; Whereas weeks in uſe for pointing out the ſeventh day ſacred are conſtant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, other weeks are not generally in uſe with all. All do not billet by the week, nor pay, nor receive wages by the week, neither do men generally make their reckonings and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts by weeks. But weeks for meaſuring out the ſix dayes of labour, and the ſeventh day ſacred, have been in uſe with all People and Nations of any note and fame, not only with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Jewes, but alſo with Turks and Heathen-Nations. Though the week was not the ſame with them all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſeventh day ſacred could not be the ſame with all; yet all had ſeven dayes to the week, and all had the ſeventh day of their week ſacred. The Turks ſeventh ſacred day with them called <hi>Algama</hi> is on our <hi>Friday,</hi> becauſe on that day <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet</hi> fled from <hi>Mecha</hi> to <hi>Jethrib</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>The Antiquity of weeks proved.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Antiquity of weeks may be gathered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from that it hath been the general practice of moſt Nations, to have juſt ſeven dayes to the week: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular day of the week to bear the name of the ſame Heatheniſh god, or planet with them all; even with thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between whom there was no commerce or traffique; and were unknown the one to the other. How can it be conceived, that many Nations ſhould have neither more nor leſſe then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes to the week, and to have the day of the Sun to be Sunday with them all, and the day of the Moon to be Munday with all, and ſo every week-day to be the ſame with them all, (except with the Jewes and Turks, who only as far as I can reade of, altered their week, the Jew beginning the ſame on the Sunday, and the Turk on the Saterday, for the reaſons before given) had not their Anceſtors (before ever they were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, far from the land of <hi>Shinar</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi>) under the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Monarchy, in the time the planets were held the gods of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118373:40"/>the world, ſo counted the week, and called every week-day by the name of the ſame planet, as now generally we do.</p>
               <p>They who ſhall be alive in <hi>America</hi> three hundred yeares hence, and ſee there ſo many Nations of different tongues, and all to have juſt ſeven dayes to the week, and all to have Sunday for their ſeventh ſacred day, and call every of their other week-dayes alike, will they not ſay or conceive that this could never have ſo happened, had not their Anceſtors in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> obſerved weeks, and had juſt ſo many dayes to the week, and call every day of the week by the ſame names before ever they removed thence, and were diſperſed into ſo many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious plantations in <hi>America?</hi> The like may we well conceive of the ancient Saxons, Romanes, Egyptians, and other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nations, that it could never ſo have happened, that every of them ſhould have weeks, and juſt ſeven dayes to the week, and every week-day to be called by the name of the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with them all, had not their Anceſtors under the Aſſyrian Monarchs, who firſt ſet up the idolatry of worſhipping the planets, obſerved ſeven dayes to the week, and called the week-dayes by the ſame names of the planets, before they came to be planted abroad in ſeveral Nations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt had no other meaſure to mete out his age and time, but dayes and weeks. Theſe he had from the Lords ſtandard, who having wrought ſix dayes and reſted the ſeventh, did ſanctifie the ſeventh day. <hi>Adam</hi> knew all erea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at the firſt ſight of them, and gave names to the creatures ſuitable to their natures. He knew them to be not eternal, nor a year old, and therefore might as well know their age to a day. When the Lord brought <hi>Eve</hi> unto him he knew her by ſight. He knew ſhe was not three dayes, nor a day old. He knew that ſhe was made of him, and on the ſame ſixth day in which he himſelf was made; and that the Lord on the next day reſted from his works of Creation. By this patterne and ſtandard of the Lord, he might mete out time by weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could have any experimental knowledge of moneths and years, which were afterward in time gotten by obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the courſe of the Sun and Moon. And we finde, that in ancient times there was much difference and variation in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118373:40"/>count of yeares and moneths with people: Some had but three moneths, ſome ten, the Jewes had ſometimes twelve, and ſometimes thirteen moneths to the yeare. Their moneths did alſo much differ for length, but never was the week count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more or leſſe then ſeven dayes with any people.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, from the teſtimony of ancient heathen Poets, ſuch as <hi>Homer, Heſiod, Gallimachus</hi> &amp; <hi>Liuus,</hi> who have ſpoken very lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably of the Creation and of the ſeventh day
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Clem. Alexan. Strom. l.</hi> 5.</note>. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Creation, and of the ſeventh day, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the count of dayes by ſevens or weeks, they could not have but by tradition, or from the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> From the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> doubtleſſe they had it not, for they were not extant in the Greek tongue, untill <hi>Prolomie</hi> prevailed to get ſeventy two Seniors of the Jewes to turn them into Greek, which was many hundreds of yeares after <hi>Homer.</hi> While-as the Kingdomes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> flouriſhed, the Gentiles could never get the leaſt parcel of ſacred Scripture. The Jewes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118373:41"/>counted it to be an high prophanation of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if they were any wayes communicated to the Heathen. <hi>John Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> plentifully ſheweth and proveth, that before this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was made by the ſaid 72 Seniors, the Heathen had no light from the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Jo Greg. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, &amp;c.</note>. If it ſhould be ſuppoſed that the Poets got the knowledge of the ſeventh day from the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then muſt it be the Jewes Saterday-Sabbath which they ſpake ſo laudably of; but they knew that to be an holy day with them no ancienter then <hi>Moſes, Septimum diem more Gentis Sabbatum appellatum in omne oevum jejunio ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cravit</hi> Moſes; <hi>The ſeventh day with that Nation, called the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> Moſes <hi>made a perpetual Holy day,</hi> ſaith <hi>Trogus</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Trog. l.</hi> 36.</note>; for which ſuppoſed innovation brought in by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Heathen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally envied them, and their Poets wrote very diſgracefully of them about their Sabbath-day. It was not then from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by tradition, that they had the knowledge of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and of the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Gomarus,</hi> who with all his might oppoſed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Sabbath-day, doth yet acknowledge, that <hi>Adam, Methuſelah, Sem</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> had knowledge of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and of the ſeventh day
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gomar. de Sab. p.</hi> 113.</note>; And why not <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, and thouſands beſide them? <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed had a full knowledge by divine revelation, and infallible inſpiration by the Holy Ghoſt, which guided him in the Hiſtorical relation of the Creation of all things, and of the day of Gods reſt, as well as of other things related in his books, yet queſtionleſſe he had ſome general knowledge by tradition, of moſt things he wrote of, as they were delivered from father to ſon unto his dayes. It would have been a very wilde conceit of <hi>Gomarus</hi> to think, when he wrote that the knowledge of the Creation and of the ſeventh day, came from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> and from him to <hi>Sem,</hi> and from <hi>Sem</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was intailed to the heires male, or to ſome perſons in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal deſcent from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not to others alſo. Incredible is it, that <hi>Noah</hi> ſhould teach the knowledge thereof to <hi>Sem</hi> only, and not to <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> too; and that <hi>Sem</hi> ſhould reveal the ſame to <hi>Arphaxad</hi> only, keeping it as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from all other his ſonnes and daughters: and that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaxad</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:118373:41"/>ſhould do the like unto <hi>Sala,</hi> and he to <hi>Heber,</hi> and he to <hi>Peleg,</hi> and he to <hi>Reu,</hi> and he to <hi>Serug,</hi> and he to <hi>Nahor,</hi> and he to <hi>Terah,</hi> and he to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and that none of them ſhould impart that knowledge to any other of their ſonnes and daughters: and that the remembrance, as well of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as of the Creation, was wholly extinct with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raham.</hi> Without all peradventure <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> and their Poſterities had and retained the knowledge thereof for many generations; ſome of them to the dayes of the before-named Poets, and long after too. <hi>Orpheus, Aeſchylus, Aratus, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus, Epicharmus,</hi> and others mentioned by <hi>Clemens,</hi> could elſe never have ſpoken ſo truly of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (whom they called <hi>Jove,</hi>) as he relateth them to have done

               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Ironſide</hi> profeſſeth that he maketh no queſtion, but that the Heathen who never heard of a ſeventh-day Sabbath, have weeks as well as moneths and years

But he thinks they had the knowledge hereof by the ſubdiviſion of moneths, as if knowing moſt of our moneths to conſiſt of one and thirty dayes, by ſubdividing them there muſt be juſt ſeven, rather then eight dayes to the week. And a little after, <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus <hi>brings many Authorities out of</hi> Homer, Heſiod <hi>and</hi> Callimachus, <hi>to prove that the very Heathen knew that the ſeventh day was to be kept holy</hi>

                     <hi>Ironſ. chap.</hi> 9.</note>; which they could not know or do without the obſervation of weeks, but herein he holds them to be thieves of holy things, having ſtolne this light out of <hi>Moſcs</hi> writings, which they had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: whereas the Heathen had not <hi>Moſes</hi> books tranſlated, hundreds of years after <hi>Homer,</hi> as I before ſhewed; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I referre the Reader to that learned Diſcourſe of <hi>John Gregory</hi> of the ſeventy Interpreters.</p>

He ſaith further, <hi>That they are more nice then wiſe, who out of a deſire to have all things new, would have new names for every day</hi> (of the week he meaneth) <hi>or call them as ſometimes they were, The firſt day of the week, the ſecond day of the week, &amp;c. and all for feare leſt it be thought that we do ſtill adore thoſe gods whom the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles worſhipped.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> as it ſeems, had met with ſome this way affected, and thus diſputes the Caſe with <hi>Fauſtus Manichaeus.

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Objection againſt Antiquity of weeks anſwered. The hourely Government of the Planets is feigned.</head>
               <p>THere be many who have publiſhed abroad to the world, that there is a certain hourly Rule or Government which the planets have given them of the Creator, by which every of them ſucceſſively, and in a viciſſitude, doth govern his houre according to this common diſtich,
<q>
                     <l>Cynthia, Mercurius, Venus, &amp; Sol, Mars, Jove, Satur,</l>
                     <l>Ordine retrogado ſibi quivis vindicat horam.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence they ſay, that until this hourely Government was by skilful Aſtronomers found out and known, the Gentiles had no weeks, and having no weeks they could not have the ſeventh day ſacred; ſuppoſing none before this to have weeks but the Jewes only, and therefore none but they to have a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.</p>
               <p>Among many other Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> was of this opinion, who from hence doth argue the Sabbath-day not to be moral, being not obſerved or known but by the Jewes only. He would have us take it for granted, that no Nation without the knowledge of Aſtrology, (the Jewes excepted) whereby men came firſt to know the planets hourely Government, and ſo conſequently what planet governed the firſt houre in every day, could have weeks, or call the week-dayes by the names of the planets. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>following the motion of the planets, gave to each day the name of that particular planet, by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118373:43"/>which the firſt houre of the day was governed as their Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had taught them</hi>

                     <hi>Heyl. par.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 61.</note>. And he aſſumeth that Aſtrologers found out this knowledge of the Planetary government but in later times. All the Chaldean Aſtrologers, all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians among the Perſians he held to be ignorant herein, and therefore during the Aſſyrian and Perſian Monarchy weeks not to be in uſe. Yea he tells us farther that neither the Greeks, nor Romans when they were in their greateſt flouriſh for Arts and Empire had weeks, becauſe they had not as then gotten this ſuppoſed excellency of Aſtrology, to know by the motions of the planets, what planet governed the firſt hour in every day
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heyl. part</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 84.</note>. Though the planets had (as ſome ſay) this orderly and hourely government, even from the day of their creation; Yet the Doctor holds that neither <hi>Plato,</hi> nor <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> nor any of the famous Aſtronomers before <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> had gotten this excellency. <hi>Firſt</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Greeks learnt the motions of the planets of</hi> Eudoxus, <hi>and therefore could not know the week before.</hi> He doth grant that they might have great. Aſtrologers among them, and yet be ignorant of this hourely government of the planets, whereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly point out the week and the dayes of the week. For he ſaith of the Romans, <hi>that they were well enough acquainted with the planets in their later times; Yet they divided not their Calendar into weeks till neer about the time of</hi> Dioniſius Exigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, <hi>who lived about the year of Chriſt</hi> 520
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heyl. par.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 84.</note>. But he holdes that they (being ignorant of the Scriptures) could not have weeks before they had gotten this knowledge by the motions of the planets. And from hence concludeth, <hi>that the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, Perſians, Greeks, and Romans, all the foure great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies did obſerve no Sabbaths, becauſe they did obſerve no weeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto I ſay, that if it be true which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would; that without the holy Scripture weeks could not be known but by the knowledge of the ſaid hourely govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Planets; and that this government of the Planets was not found till the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of late times, and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> from them had gotten the knowledge thereof; it muſt needs be confeſſed, not only what the Doctor thence inferreth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118373:43"/>that all the four great Monarchies did obſerve no Sabbath, becauſe they did obſerve no weeks. But that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the flood, and all Nations, and people whatſoever (the Jews only excepted) were without a Sabbath-day, and could not have the ſeventh day ſacred with any of them till about the time of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who was <hi>Platoes</hi> ſcholler, becauſe they neither had nor could have weeks before.</p>
               <p>But for anſwer in plain termes. It is very untrue what the Doctor alleadgeth. There was never any ſuch hourly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the planets found out, but feigned. Neither had the week-dayes their names firſt from the planets governing the firſt houre of the day. Both which I will clear and make apparent.</p>
               <p>Touching the former; There is no ſuch hourely govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment found out in deed and truth; but there hath ſuch an one feigned to be; and that upon a new order, or ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the planets made by Aſtronomers in later times.</p>
               <p>For in ancient times the Moon was held to be the loweſt planet, and the Sunne to be next unto her, and all the other five planets to be above the Sunne. This was the order of the planets generally held in ancient times by Aſtronomers

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118373:44"/>perpetually to ſound out the name of the next ſucceeding day. The other was this hourly government before-ſaid, firſt brought to light in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as is ſuppoſed; by which it will ſo fall out, that let every planet be ſuppoſed to govern his houre ſucceſſively according to this new order, it will ſo fall out that the planet which ſhall come to rule the frſt houre of the next day, will be the very ſame whoſe name that day doth bear. Both theſe I confeſſe, are very witty: but a mere fanſie. And they, who urge from hence, that the planets have ſuch an hourly rule, and government given them by their Creatour, by which every one in ſeven dayes doth conſtantly, and by courſe Rule the firſt houre of a week-day, and that thereby men came to have ſeven dayes to the week, and to call the dayes of the week by the names of the planets orderly, as they came to governe the firſt houre of the day, are meerly deluded. For had there been in truth ſuch an hourly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment given them, and had they exerciſed the ſame; then ſure</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have gotten this knowledge before all men. And then it would follow hence, that men had weeks from the beginning, even from this hourly Rule of the planets: butindeed, <hi>Adam</hi> had better ground for weeks, then the Planets could afford; which was Gods working ſix dayes and reſting the ſeventh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not known this rarity, or if he had known it, and would reveal it to none of his children; Yet the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers before the flood would doubtleſſe have found out the ſame: they were moſt excellent in the knowledge of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and many other in their writings tell us. they had ſuch experiments in, and of their obſervations, which men in future times, living not the tenth of their dayes, could never attain unto.

Surely thoſe long-lived A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers deſerved not to be of that name and fame, if ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſaid hourly government of the planets, had there been any ſuch Rule, or government then in being.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:118373:44"/>
               <p n="3">3. If it be ſuppoſed that none before the flood were ſuch excellent Aſtrologers, yet the Chaldees, whoſe Religion was in adoring the Hoſt of Heaven, and in ſearching after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and effects of the Planets, who beſtowed their whole time therein, even from their childehood: who inſtructed their little children in the knowledge of the ſtarres
<note n="b" place="margin">Beëmus ubi dee Aſſyria.</note>, as we teach children the Catechiſme; theſe I ſay of all other ſince the flood, ſhould have been the finders out of this Rule and Government of the Planets had there been any ſuch among them. A vanity is it to imagine, that ſuch an excellency ſhould be kept ſecret from the Creation during thouſands of yeares, and not found out till in late times, by ſome Egyptians of no note or name; whereas the diſcoverers thereof (had there been ſuch a thing indeed found out) deſerved to have their names ingraven in marble for their laſting memory to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages.</p>

If this hourely Government be really true, then there can but one planet govern the firſt houre of one and the ſame day, at one and the ſame place; and which ſhall give name to that day; if otherwiſe, then this hourely rule is not ſound, but feigned. Now we know, that one and the ſame day at one and the ſame place, may be <hi>Friday, Saterday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons.

It will fall out, that the Turk by going weſtward, having lost a day; and the Chriſtian going Eaſtward, having got a day; one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame day will be a Friday to the Turk, a Saterday to the Jew, and a Sunday to the Chriſtian.</hi> Sith then one and the ſame day came to be a Friday, a Saterday, and a Sunday unto theſe three by their travel, there muſt be three ſeveral planets to govern the firſt houre of that day; or elſe the planets muſt by little and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118373:45"/>little have gotten and loſt a whole courſe of governing, as the travellers did by little and little gain and loſe a whole day by their travel; both which will ſhew this hourly rule of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to be both vain and feigned.</p>
               <p>Touching the later, that week-dayes had not their names from the ſuppoſed hourly rule of the planets, may from theſe reaſons be gathered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this hourely rule doth flow from the names of the week-dayes, and not the week-day names from it. Men muſt firſt know by what planets name the day is called, before they can tell what planet muſt govern the firſt houre thereof. For ſuppoſe the two travellers before-ſaid, the Chriſtian and the Turk, had met at any place before they had ended their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: it muſt be as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath demonſtrated the like

                     <hi>Heyl. par.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 46, 47, 48.</note>, Sunday then with the Turk, when it was but Saterday with the Chriſtian then at their meeting. Now let the moſt skilful of Aſtrologers be demanded, what day it ſhould be unto them both, either Saterday or Sunday? whether the Sun or <hi>Saturn</hi> ruled the firſt houre thereof? he will anſwer as the Chaldees did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, There is not a man upon the earth that can ſhew this matter</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 2.10.</note> Yea though the place where thoſe travellers met were made known alſo, yet would the queſtion remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolveable, unleſſe there be ſome line or other ſuppoſed, where the planets ſhould begin their Government, and from whence the calculation is to be made: but in that ſuppoſal there is no certainty. Now if the ſaid travellers agree together, to have that day of their meeting to be Sunday, then any Aſtrologer will readily tell them, that the Sun was he that ruled the firſt houre thereof: or if they make it Saterday, then <hi>Saturn</hi> was he. Firſt therefore the week-dayes muſt be known, before men can know the ſaid planetary Rule and Government. I would not have any conceive, that by the Planetary Rule and Government, I ſhould mean here that Government and Lordſhip, which the planets are of old ſaid to have in their own home and houſes; it is the hourely Rule of the Planets, mentioned in the beginning of this chapter that I mean. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelf to be but little skilled in the one; but this he that hath but the uſe of a paire of Globes may demonſtrate to be falſe, and to have no truth in it.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The Germanes had weeks, and called the week-dayes by the names of their gods whom they adored, which were the ſeven planets, and this long before they came to have any knowledge of this hourely rule of the planets, which <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Haſſianus</hi> got in <hi>Paris,</hi> and then after taught the ſame in <hi>Vienna:</hi> and that not yet foure hundred years ſince.

If any ſay that the Germanes had learnt to have weeks, and to call the dayes of the week by the names of the planets, ſince the ſaid hourely rule was found out, and that either from the Romanes or Grecians, or from ſome other Nation with whom they lived, before they came to inhabit in <hi>Germany:</hi> as the French, the Engliſh, the Dutch, and other people in <hi>America</hi> have weeks, and call the week-dayes by the ſame Names thoſe Nations did, with whom their Anceſtors lived before they came into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> My anſwer is, they are much miſtaken; for <hi>Germany</hi> was a very ancient Kingdom, as <hi>Theodore Bibliander,</hi> and <hi>Verſtegan</hi> alſo do acquaint us. <hi>Twiſco,</hi> who before he died was a King, and the firſt King of the Germanes was borne long before there was a Monarchy of the Romanes, Grecians or Perſians either.

Week-dayes bear the names of the planets, not from the ſaid late invented hourely rule, ſuppoſed to be given them by God when he created them, but as they were the Heathens gods, and were orderly worſhipped and adored by them. Thus the day we call Sunday. was by the Heathen anciently called the day of the Sun, becauſe of all the planets who were held to be the Lords and Governours of the world; he was that Lord and Governour which had ſpecial worſhip done unto him on that day, and for that his worſhip began with that dayes beginning, even at the Sun-riſing, (for at that time did the Heathen begin their worſhip to the Sun, and to every of the reſt of the Hoſt of heaven, as I have ſhewed before,) which was the firſt houre of the day with them; he hath been ſaid and held, to begin his Lordſhip or Government on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or firſt houre of that day; and hence is it that that day was by the ancient Heathen called the day of the Sun: the like may be ſaid of the other names of all the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes.</p>
               <p>That the week-dayes were by the Heathens called by the names of the planets as they were the Heathens gods adored by them is evident, not only from the teſtimonies of ſundry learned men, but alſo from Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> own pen.

No ſure, it was for that the Gentiles generally, as Romanes and Greeks, did call the dayes of the week as they were taught from their Anceſtors, and they from theirs, even by the names of their gods which of old they adored, who were the ſeven planets; and for that Chriſtians alſo generally (except Jewes) did call them ſo in like manner, as their Heathen Anceſtors did, even in the time when this Pope lived: which ſo diſpleaſed the ſaid Pope, that in deteſtation of the memory of thoſe Heathen gods, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the names of the week-dayes, and decreed to have them called by the names of <hi>Feriae.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> proving this, citeth <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> for his authority, <hi>Sylvester Romanus Pontifex ejus nominis primus, vanorum deorum memoriam in abhorrens

               <p>Thus having now been ſhewed, firſt that there is indeed no ſuch hourly Government as is pretended; And ſecondly, that the week dayes had not their names from thence: Any man may ſee the weakneſſe of Dr <hi>Heylins</hi> principal argument, to prove thereby, that neither of the foure great Monarchies, nor any People elſe, the Jewes only excepted, had weeks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Sabbath.</p>

               <p>Now common ſenſe and reaſon will tell us, that the day which was by them dedicated to their chiefeſt God, and bare his name; the day of the Sun, which we call Sunday, muſt be with them the chiefeſt day of all the ſeven in their eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore was it with them not only a ſeventh day of the week, but the ſeventh day <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>Neither was Sunday the 7th day of the week with the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Gentiles only, but was alſo, as it is moſt probable, that ſeventh day which the Patriarchs before the flood held to the honour of the Creator, in remembrance of the Creation, and of Gods reſting on the ſeventh day. For when <hi>Nimrod</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Saturnus Babylonicus, Belus</hi> his ſonne, and other Potentates of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> had idolatrouſly ſet up the whole Hoſt of heaven, that is the Sunne, Moon, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther planets, with conſtellations ſubſervient to them; which of the ſeven dayes of the week, will any reaſonable man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, did they dedicate to the honour of their greateſt god the Sun, rather then that, which before was held to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God the Creatour? ſurely not any other. And when theſe Aſſyrian and Chaldean Powers had, as much as in them lay, robbed God (if I may ſo ſay) of his Titles, Attributes, Providence, Works of Creation, Government and Worſhip; and gave the chief of all their ſpoiles to their chiefeſt god the Sun; <hi>Nimrod</hi> giving him the name <hi>Baal</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Jo Greg. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyr. Monar.</note>, which he afterwards aſſumed to himſelf
<note n="b" place="margin">Jo Greg. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyr. Monar.</note>, <hi>Belus</hi> giving him the name <hi>Jove</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Jo Greg. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyr. Monar.</note>, (<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> in the Hebrew) the which he aſſumed afterward unto himſelf

                  <note n="c" place="margin">Biblian.</note>. They called the Sun God, and held him the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all things: and that the world was not created, but was from everlaſting governed by the planets, the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118373:48"/>chief and ſoveraign Ruler: Would they not do the like, may any one think, with that day which was held to the honour of the Creatour? All that was known to be for the worſhip and honour of God the Creatour, they gave to the honour of the Sun; and therefore doubtleſſe they deputed to the Sun that day alſo.</p>
               <p>Again, when they aſſigned to every of thoſe gods the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveral dayes of the week, no indifferent underſtanding man but will conceive that they would dedicate to their greateſt god the Sun, the day held before to the honour of the great God of heaven and earth, rather then to the <hi>Moon, Mercury,</hi> or other inferiour gods. So that moſt likely, the ſeventh day with the Patriarchs, was none other, but that which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was the Suns day with the Aſſyrians, and from them was called the day of the Sun with other Nations alſo, as the other week-dayes were called by the names of the other planets: and ſo by cuſtome have they continued to be called with all Nations of any note for Civility and Knowledge, except with the Jewes only, who after their coming our of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day aſſigned unto them for their ſeventh ſacred day; and had a ſpecial command given them, not to make any mention of thoſe gods of the Nations, nor to have their names at all in their mouth, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sunday was the ſeventh day of the week with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as may be collected from the pens of many learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as well Chriſtian as Heathen.</p>

All of them were Heathen, yet all of them ſpake very laudably of the ſeventh ſacred day. Their words for brevities ſake I will not here rehearſe, ſith they are to be ſeen, and are urged by many Writers, as namely, <hi>Clem. Alexand. Strom. l.</hi> 5. <hi>Euſeb. de Praep.

Now the ſeventh day ſo laudably by them ſpoken of, was the day of the Sun. For 1. It was not Saterday the Jewes ſeventh day. The Gentiles liked the Jewes Saterday, as (ſaid a Papiſt) the devil doth holy water. It was counted by them a diſdainful novelty; their Poets commonly would have one laſh or other at the Jewes for it, and never ſpake in honour thereof. 2. The Adverſaries themſelves do grant that the day of the Sun was the ſeventh day, and ſacred alſo with the Heathen; but here's their evaſion, <hi>The ſeventh day ſacred to the Sun with the Heathen,</hi> ſay they, <hi>was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the moneth, and not the ſeventh day of the week.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the day of the Sun was the ſeventh day of the week with the Heathen, and not the ſeventh day of the moneth, thus I prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> both alledge the ſaid Poets, to ſhew that the Gentiles had the ſeventh day of the week ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other Authors generally take Sunday with the Gentiles for a week-day, and not for the day of a moneth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had the ſeventh day ſacred to the Sun been the ſeventh day of every moneth, as they affirme, the Greeks doubtleſſe would have noted the ſame down in their Calenders. Though they could not ſet down conſtantly the ſeventh day of the week, by reaſon of their intercaling ſo many dayes at a time, no more then others then could do; and no more then we can ſet down the moveable Feaſts that were with us, unleſſe it be in a yearly Almanack, before that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> had corrected the year. Yet never ſhall we ſee a Calender, in which the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal immovable ſacred dayes were omitted. Now there is an ancient Attick Calender to be ſeen in <hi>Scaliger de emend. temp.</hi> wherein things of leſſe conſequence are noted; but this ſeventh day ſacred to the Sun in each moneth cannot be found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Dr. <hi>Frances White</hi> and Dr <hi>Heylin</hi> alſo tell us

                     <hi>White of the Sabbath p.</hi> 197. <hi>Heyl. part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 53.</note>, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the firſt ages, becauſe they kept the Sunday for their ſacred ſervices, and bowed Eaſtward in their worſhip, were upbraided for Sun-worſhippers, though they neither worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Sun, nor called their day of worſhipping God Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118373:49"/>but the Lords day, being their Sabbathr ſacred day of reſt to the Lord. Surely if Sunday had not been with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who were Sun-worſhippers indeed, a weekly ſervice day, but the ſeventh day of the moneth only, there had been no cauſe or ground, why either Jew or Gentile ſhould have caſt ſuch an aſperſion on them of being worſhippers of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This may further appear by the decree of Pope <hi>Milchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Miltiades,</hi> the laſt of all the Popes that were Martyrs. He to make a clear difference between the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Sunday by Chriſtians, and the obſervation of Sunday by the Heathen, ordained that all Gentiles who were converted and were Chriſtians, ſhould not faſt on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes nor on the Thurſdayes, as the other Gentiles did. Note, that as Wedneſday, Friday and Sunday, were now in late times called ſacred or Prayer-dayes; ſo were Thurſday and Sunday in old times; on which dayes they filled not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as on other dayes till their ſacred ſervices were ended. The decree <hi>Sever. Binius</hi> on the life of the ſaid Pope ſets down thus: <hi>Jejunium verò Dominici diei, &amp; quintae feriae nemo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brare debet; ut inter jejunium Chriſtianorum, &amp; Gentilium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciter, &amp;c.</hi> He would not that Chriſtians ſhould faſt on the Thurſday, and on the Lords day, called by the Gentiles Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that ſo there might be an open and apparent diſtinction between Chriſtians and the Heathen in the obſervation of thoſe dayes. From which time till of late, our tables have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified obedience to that decree, being uſually furniſhed with more variety of diſhes on the Sundayes and Thurſdayes, then on any day of the week beſides. If any one here ſay, that theſe dayes were not ſacred but Faſting dayes, becauſe <hi>Binius</hi> calls them <hi>jejunia;</hi> I would have him informed, that ſacred dayes were with the Heathen called Faſts, becauſe they abſtained from feeding themſelves till their ſervices were ended: the like did the Jewes, yea and Chriſtians too in old time. <hi>Trogus</hi> writing the cuſtomes of the Jewes, when he would tell us that <hi>Moſes</hi> ordained the Saterday, being the ſeventh day with the Jewes, to be a ſacred day perpetually, he thus expreſſeth the ſame. <hi>Septimum diem more Gentis Sabbatum appellatum, in

But to put us out of doubt that the Thurſday, and Sunday were not only faſting dayes but ſacred alſo with the Heathen, <hi>Platina</hi> reſolveth the caſe: who, on the life of the ſaid Pope, ſets down his decree thus. <hi>Miltiadis inſtitutum fuit, nè Dominico, neve feriâ quintâ jejunaretur; quia hos dies Pagani quaſi ſacros celebrant.</hi> Whereby it appears, that Sunday was a ſacred day, not of the moneth, but of the week with the Heathen.</p>

               <p>It ſeemeth by theſe that Chriſtians at firſt, deveſted the Sunne of the worſhip given him on the day of the Sunne, and gave the whole right of worſhip on that day unto the Lord God. They ſerved the day of the Sunne as the men of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118373:50"/>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to ſerve their captive maidens; the things that grew excrementitiouſly on them, as hair, and nailes were to be ſhaven, and cut
<note n="a" place="margin">Deut 21.12</note>; and ſo caſt away, &amp;c. and then the men lawfully might keep, and uſe them: So Chriſtians of the firſt age after Chriſts aſcenſion, pared off, and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what did excrementitiouſly (if I may ſo ſay) grow on the day of the Sunne, as the adoration, and ſuperſtitious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices given to it on that day; and then they lawfully might, and did make uſe of the ſame; and it became their ſtanding ſervice-day unto Gods honour.</p>
               <p>Divers other teſtimonies of ſundry authors may be given to prove the day of the Sunne with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be, not their ſeventh day of the moneth, but their ſeventh day of the week; all which I here omit: only I referre the reader for his further ſatisfaction to Doctor <hi>Heylins</hi> hiſtory of the Sabbath

But alſo that the day of the Sunne is the ſame which we call Sunday, proving the ſame out of <hi>Tertullian, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here it may be demanded, that ſith the Sunday was the day ſacred with the Heathen, dedicated to the Sunne, and to the diſhonour of God ſo much abuſed by their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh ſuperſtition, and Idolatry: Whether Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time, or afterward ſhould not have done well to have choſen Friday, or Saterday, or ſome other day for their ſtanding day of the week for Gods ſervice rather then the Sunday?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To alter or change the Sabbath from the ſeventh day, and to make it the eighth, ninth, ſixth, or any other then the ſeventh, which is the laſt day of the week, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the expreſſe law of God, as before hath been ſhewed, though it be nowhere forbidden to alter the whole week by beginning the ſame ſooner, or later.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they lawfully might, and did alter and change both the name, and alſo the worſhip, or ſervice done on that day; for they called it no longer Sunday unleſſe in their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118373:50"/>common-talk with the Heathen, but they called it the <hi>Lords day;</hi> being the day which the Lord in this law commanded to be ſanctifyed; Neither did they adore, and worſhip the Sunne any more on that day, but the Lord their Creatour, and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is true that all the week-dayes were abuſed to the Idolatrous worſhip of the planets, though not in the like degree as was the Sunday: And that one day, in it ſelf, was no more holy then another; Yet Chriſtians ſhould not have done well in changing, or in their endeavouring to have changed their ſtanding ſervice-day, from Sunday to any other day of the week; and that for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the contempt, ſcorn and deriſion they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhould be had in among all the Gentiles with whom they lived; and toward whom they ought by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule to live inoffenſively
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.32</note> in things indifferent. If the <hi>Gentiles</hi> thought hardly, and ſpake evil of them, for that they <hi>ran not into the ſame exceſſe of riot with them</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.4</note>: what would they have ſaid of Chriſtians for ſuch an Innovation as would have been made by their change of their ſtanding ſervice-day? If long before this, the Jews were had in ſuch diſdain among the Gentiles for their Saterday-Sabbath (which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles held to be a ſingularity, and innovation brought in by <hi>Moſes)</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Jeremy</hi> lamenteth the ſame
<note n="a" place="margin">Lam. 1.17.</note>. How grievous would be their Taunts and reproaches againſt the poore Chriſtians living with them, and under their power, for their new ſet ſacred day, had the Chriſtians choſen any other then the Sunday? Had Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cavendiſe,</hi> and their companies, who travelled round the earth with them, either out of tenderneſſe of conſcience, or elſe out of obſtinacy continued to keep that Sunday ſacred which fel to them by courſe, &amp; true tale of the days ſucceeding each other: they muſt needs have had their Sunday on our Munday, &amp; our Sunday would be their Saterday: When it was holy day with them, it would be workingday with us; and holy day with us when they would work.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118373:51"/>how unquiet, may any one imagine ſhould thoſe Travellers have lived among us, as long as our Sunday was a week-day with them. Would not every ballad-maker have had them in their rimes? would they not have been a by-word with all? and every Apparator would be ready with a Citation for them. And can we conceive that Chriſtians at firſt ſhould find more favour from the Heathen for their wilfulneſſe which was leſſe excuſeable?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moſt Chriſtians then were either Servants or of the poorer ſort of people: and the Gentiles (moſt probably) would not give their ſervants liberty to ceaſe from working on any other ſet day conſtantly, except on their Sunday.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had they changed their ſeventh day from their Sunday to another day, there muſt have followed an unſufferable confuſion in the count of the week dayes with whom they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved As for example: had Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſerved at his returne, the weeks which by his exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count fell to them by courſe; and not have changed them, and made them the ſame with our weeks, there would have followed a miſerable confuſion even in their own families. The third day of the week with ſome muſt have been the fourth with others of the ſame family. And never a day would have been the ſame with them all. The like would it have been with the Chriſtians and Gentiles with whom they lived, if they had changed their ſeventh ſtanding day for Gods worſhip (which was Sunday) for another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe had they aſſayed ſuch a change, it would have been a teſtimony againſt them of ſlighting the glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Lord and Saviour, <hi>the Sunne of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>

               <p n="5">5. It would have been but labour in vaine for them to have aſſayed the ſame, they could never have brought it to paſſe. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. They had no authoritative ſpecification of any ſet day ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Jeſus Chriſt, or by his Apoſtles on which they ought to keep the Lords day. Had there ſo been, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would never have preſt the indifferency of dayes, as he did
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 14.1, 2, 3. Col. 2.16.</note>, nor

               <p n="2">2. They had no coercive power to draw refuſers to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of any other day for the Lords day, had they been ſo diſpoſed to have ſet any other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſtians were not all of one City, or of one countrey, or of one Nation, Tongue or Government. It would have been even a miracle to have gotten all Chriſtians in all parts of the world to have obſerved one &amp; the ſame day for the Lords day with them all, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhould be choſen, not by a general meeting, or by a general conſent, but by ſome of them only, had they choſen any other then the day of the Sun, which they were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally before their Converſion accuſtomed to keep. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were but one Nation all of one Tongue, and ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all other People, and alſo had <hi>Moſes</hi> their Captain-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould never have withdrawn them from their old accuſtomed day, to the obſervation of the Saterday-Sabbath, different from the cuſtome of all other Nations, had not the Lord God miraculouſly in the fal of Quails &amp; Manna
<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 16.12, 16, 22, 23, 26.</note>, ſhewed that it was his good pleaſure ſo to have it, when he aſſigned unto them their ſix dayes for their labour, and ſo pointing out to them the Saterday, being the ſeventh from their firſt gathering Quailes and Manna, to be the day of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt unto the Lord. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the firſt Pope of that name, when out of his hatred to the memory of the Heathen-gods, he would have changed but the names of the week-dayes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed them to be called by the names of <hi>Feriae</hi> as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed; though he was of great authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and highly beloved of the people; yet he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail herein but with very few except Schollers; the vulgar people in their common talk, called their week-dayes as they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118373:52"/>did before, by the names of the Planets; and ſo have they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to call them, even to this day. The Jewes are now a weak People, yet there is not a Prince or Power on earth able to withdraw them from their ſuperſtitious cuſtome of keeping the Saterday ſacred; yea the believing Jewes, as was ſhewed, in the Apoſtles time, and in many years after could not be wonne by any means that the Chriſtians might uſe, to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Saterday-Sabbath, and for unities ſake to keep the Lords day on the Sunday, except a very few of them who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knew and acknowledged their liberty by Chriſt. How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible may we then think it to be for any to bring to paſſe, that all Chriſtians in all quarters of the world, ſhould leave off their obſerving the Sunday ſacred, and have another day in ſtead thereof? In vain therefore would it have been, for poor Chriſtians at firſt to have aſſayed the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons, if there were no more, may ſuffice to ſhew, that although all dayes be in themſelves indifferent: yet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not have well done, had they endeavoured to have changed their ſeventh ſacred day, from Sunday to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther week-day; no not to Thurſday, though it was the day of Chriſt his glorious Aſcenſion; nor to Friday, though it was the day in which Chriſt paid our ranſome: but betrer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame day as they did; and which the Church of Chriſt hath ſince that kept, even to this preſent time, and by Gods grace will ſo do unto the end.</p>

               <p>Now in the next place is to be ſhewed how the Lords day is to be ſanctified. To the ſanctification of the Sabbath-day of the Lord, which we call the Lords day, two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we keep it a day of reſt.</item>
                  <item>2. That we ſanctifie that time of reſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That we are to keep it a day of reſt the Scripture fully ſheweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt, in earing time and in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 34.21.</note>. The like have we in divers other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, calling it a day of reſt.</p>
               <p>All men are to ceaſe from the works of their calling, which on other dayes they lawfully may, yea and ought to do for the maintenance of themſelves and theirs. <hi>Six dayes ſhall work be done, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of reſt, ye ſhall do no work therein</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But whereas we are here forbidden to do any work, we muſt not ſo underſtand the words, as if on the Sabbath-day we ſhould reſt from all kinde and manner of works, and ſo do no work at all upon that day, the words of the text do not bear ſuch a ſenſe.

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 5.14.</note>, where <hi>Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>

                  <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 35.2</note>. Where <hi>Pagnine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnis faciens opus in die Sabbati:</hi> it is thus to be read according to <hi>Montanus, Omnis faciens opificium in die ceſſationis
<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 31.15.</note>, &amp;c.</hi> The like may be ſeen in divers other places of Scripture, ſo tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the one, and ſo corrected by the other. Whence we may gather that the true meaning of theſe words commonly read in our tranſlations, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do any work:</hi> is not that we ſhould do no manner of work at all; but that we ſhould do on the Sabbath-day no manner of the works of our trade, function and occupation. The Smith is not to work at his Anvil, nor the Shoomaker with his Awle, nor any other about any works that belong to mens trade and profeſſion, which on the ſix dayes of labour they may and ſhould do for getting their maintenance and livelihood.</p>
               <p>There be ſome other works which on every day may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done, even on the Sabbath-day it ſelf without the leaſt breach of this law, and they are of three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Works of Piety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Works of Government towards the creature ſubjected to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Works needful to the preſervation of mans life.</p>
               <p>Theſe works may be done on every day without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Law of the Sabbath. Neither doth the law of the Sabbath abridge us from doing them on any day.</p>
               <p>What God ordained before ever the ſeventh day was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was not, and is not nulled or abridged by the law of the Sabbath, but theſe works were before ordained by the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Man was made and had his being to ſerve God, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worſhip him, to perform duties of Piety, in ſuch manner as he ſhould appoint him. The doing of theſe duties on the Sabbath-day doth no violation to the law of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Men doing them may be ſaid to break or profane the Sabbath; yet not break the law of the Sabbath. When we have been diligent on the Sabbath-day in doing ſervice unto God, and the duties he requireth of us for his honour, we may therein be ſaid not to make the day a day of reſt, but to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118373:53"/>break the reſt or Sabbath; yet not to break the Commandment by doing theſe works. Thus Chriſt told the Phariſees, that the Prieſts in the Temple did profane the Sabbath and are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 12.5.</note>. Sure they could not be ſaid to be blameleſſe, had they by their ſacrificing bullocks or ſheep broken the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they brake the Sabbath, they made it not a day of reſt from theſe works, and ſo were ſaid to profane it, that is, in reſpect of theſe labours they made it common with other dayes; all dayes being alike lawful or common for doing works of Piety.</p>
               <p>Secondly, works of Government of the Creatures ſubjected unto man, were ordained of the Lord before man was made. <hi>Let us make man</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in our image after our likeneſſe, and let them have dominion over, &amp;c</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1.26, 28</note>. and when God had made man, he commanded them to have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, over the fowle over cattel, and over every living thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. This law and ordinance was not repealed or nulled by any ſucceding law. Man is to exerciſe this his Rule and Government committed unto him on any day. If fire ſhould threaten to deſtroy houſe or houſes, corne, or ſuch like on the Sabbath-day, man is as well bound to uſe his power in ſuppreſſing the ſame on the Sabbath-day as on any other. If water indanger drowning of cattel, or if cattel ſtrive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whereby ſome are like to periſh, and man do not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and ſeek to preſerve what was in danger becauſe it was on the Sabbath-day, he ſheweth himſelf to be a bad Governour of the creature; or if he ſhould ſuffer ſheep or other cattel to periſh for want of foddering, folding, or houſing them, as need requireth, he is not worthy to have the Government of cattel.</p>
               <p>The like Iſay, concerning works needful for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans life. When <hi>Adam</hi> was in the ſtate of innocency, before ever the ſeventh day was, even on the day of his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord ordained him food. <hi>Behold, I have given you,</hi> ſaid God, <hi>every herbe bearing ſeed,</hi> (ſome whereof were Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical) <hi>which is upon the face of all the earth: and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding ſeed, to you it ſhall be for meat</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 1.29.</note>. It was Gods Will and Ordinance then, that man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118373:54"/>being made a living ſoul ſhould uſe the means for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his life. And this his ordinance, was never repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any ſucceeding law. All theſe three kinde of works may be done on the Sabbath-day as well as on other dayes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes provided that there be no irregularity in performing them. We muſt have regard to neceſſity requiring preſent help; when this giveth way, the duties more excellent are more eſpecially to be regarded. And as theſe works may be done on the Lords day, ſo may the neceſſary helps thereunto be then done alſo. A man may on the Sabbath-day travel on foot to the meeting place, and aſſembly of Gods people; and if he cannot well go on foot he may ride. Alſo as men may feed, folde or houſe their Cattel on the Lords day, ſo may they uſe the neceſſary helps thereto, which could not be done the day before. And ſo alſo may they not only eat, drink, ſleep, and take Phyſick according as need requireth, but alſo may uſe needfull helps thereunto; as heating their meat, and ſuch like; for all ſtomacks cannot feed on cold meat. But let all take heed leſt under a pretence of neceſſity, he robs God of his due honour, and his conſcience of true peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here ſome will object <hi>that this Commandment tyed the Jews from kindling any fire on their Sabbath-day.</hi> If then we are bound to keep this law as ſtrictly as the Jews were, we ought not to kindle fire at all upon the Sabbath-day for any occaſion whatſoever, though for ſaving ones life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To which I anſwer: that this precept in <hi>Exodus</hi> the five and thirtieth Chapter,
<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 35.3.</note> and third Verſe forbade the Jews not from making any fire at all, whether it be a help towards the duties of piety, or mens health and ſafety: But from making fire, whereby it ſhould be a help towards their trades, occupations or functions which are expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be done in this commandment on the Sabbath-day. And that this is the meaning may appear, for that</p>
               <p>Firſt, this precept hath an eye, and refiecteth on the words immediately going before in the former verſe, in which is a rehearſal of the ſumme of this fourth commandment. In theſe words, according to the Hebrew text
<note n="d" place="margin">Arias Monte.</note>, <hi>Six dayes ſhall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:118373:54"/>(occupation or trade) <hi>be done, and in the ſeventh day there ſhall be to you holineſſe, a reſt of ceſſation to the Lord, every one doing his function in that day ſhall die.</hi> Then immediately followeth, <hi>There ſhall no fire be kindled in all your habitations in the day of ceſſation.</hi> The works about mens perſonal callings, and functions for getting wealth being forbidden in the former verſe; in this is forbidden the means tending thereto, as the kindling of fire. And haply kindling fire is here mentioned rather then any other means; for that they being all Brickmakers in <hi>Egypt</hi> before, they kindled fire throughout their habitations for the burning their tale of Bricks. But when workes are lawful, and needful to be done on the Sabbath-day, ſuch as are works of piety, and works of preſerving the life of man, the neceſſary helps thereunto, as making fire is lawful alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the continued, and never blamed practice of the Jews of making fire on the Sabbath-day for theſe duties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſame. They were never at any time blamed for making fire on the Sabbath for theſe duties, as farre as we can read in ſacred Scripture. The man that was put to death for gathering wood (whether to fagot it, or to adde it to his Pile or heap is not expreſſed) on the Sabbath-day
<note n="b" place="margin">Num. 15.32</note>, doth make nothing hereto. And that they did make fire on the Sabbath-dayes for theſe duties is undeniable. How elſe ſhould the meat-offrings baken in ovens and in pannes, and in fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pannes be made, which they were to bring to the Prieſts as obligations
<note n="d" place="margin">Levit. 2.4, 5, 7.</note>? How elſe could the Shewbread be baked, which were conſtantly provided and ſet on the pure Table of the Lord every Sabbath day
<note n="f" place="margin">Levit. 24.5, 6 &amp;c.</note>? And how elſe ſhould the Paſchal lambe be roaſted, when the feaſt of the Paſſeover fell on the Sabbath-day? Every family was then to eat roſtmeat throughout their habitations; and the remaines to be burnt in the fire that nothing be left untill the morning
<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 12.10.</note>. Sure theſe things could not be done without making fire. In like manner did they make fire on the Sabbath for preſervation of their life and health. For doubtleſſe the Iſraelites baked and ſod their Manna on their Sabbath-dayes, as they did on the other dayes of the week. Cold Manna, and unpound would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118373:55"/>with many mens ſtomakes on the Sabbath, who on every of the other dayes did eat it hot, either baked or ſodden. On every of the other ſix dayes they gathered every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his eating, an Omer for every man
<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 16.16, 18.</note>. And then ground it, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pannes, and made Cakes of it
<note n="d" place="margin">Num. 11.8.</note>. And in that week which was ſet for the meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to them their firſt Saterday-Sabbath, which was their ſeventh day from their firſt beginning of gathering Quailes and manna; <hi>Moſes</hi> on the ſixt day (that is on the day before their new Sabbath appointed) ſaid unto them, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſaid, To morrow is the reſt of the holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath unto the Lord; bake that which you will bake to day, and ſeethe that you will ſeethe; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 16.23, 24.</note>. On this ſixth day they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered double to what they did before; whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> told them that the one part they ſhould bake or ſeeth at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but the remainder, that is the other part, they were not willed either to bake or to ſeethe on that day, but to lay it up for the next day; the which they did: and although it was neither baked nor ſodden, yet it ſtank not, neither did wormes appear therein. Now if the Iſraelites might not pound the ſaid manna laid up for their food, nor bake, nor boile the ſame, and ſo eat it hot, as on other dayes; the Sabbath-day which ſhould be a delight unto them, would breed them ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and be burthenſome unto them: and doubtleſſe then we ſhould read of their complaints hereof. We read how they complained for want of change, and wept when they remembred the fleſh, Cucumbers, Melons, Leeks, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Garlick which they had in <hi>Egypt: But now ſaid they, our ſoul is dryed away, there is nothing beſide this Manna, &amp;c</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Num. 11.6.</note>. How would they have complained if on the Sabbath-dayes they ſhould have been driven to have eaten the manna, not pound, nor baked, nor ſod? Their ſilence herein argueth them not to have been driven to ſuch a ſtrait, but that they did either bake, or boile their Manna, and ſo eat it hot as they did on the other dayes; the which could not be done without their making a fire.</p>
               <p>Or otherwiſe if by this precept the Jews were not to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118373:55"/>make any fire at all on their Sabbath-day, neither for the furtherance of their ſervices, and duties towards God, nor for the preſervation of the health, and life of man; then I ſay that that precept was particularly given to the Jews, and peculiarly concerned that Nation and no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth whatſoever. And that this Commandment bound them not thereto, no more then it bindeth us or any other people whatſoever. This law bound, and doth binde all men to make the ſeventh day with them a day of reſt, not only from works of ſlavery, commonly called <hi>ſervile works,</hi> from which the Jews were bound on their feaſt of the Paſſeover
<note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 23.7. Nun. 28.18.</note>: and on certaine other of their feaſt-dayes
<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 23.8, 21.25, 35, 36. Num. 28.25.26</note>. But alſo from all the works of mens trade, occupation, or function whatſoever: Yea our thoughts, and mindes are not to be upon them on the Lords day; as the one are called our works
<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 23.12.</note>; ſo the other are called our thoughts.</p>
               <p>This Law bindeth all, that they ſhould not only make the ſeventh day to be a day of reſt, and ceſſation from all the works of our callings; but alſo that we ſanctifie that reſt. <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that thou ſanctifie the Sabbath-day:</hi> that is in <hi>Engliſh, the day of ceſſation, or reſt,</hi> for that <hi>it is the Sabbath of the Lord.</hi> We may well call it the Lords day, or the Lords Sabbath; for that it is a day holy to the Lord: we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ceaſe from the works of our profeſſions, and callings on that day; but are then to performe alſo, and do duties, and works of holineſſe unto the Lord. On the ſeventh day is a ceſſation to reſt, <hi>a Convocation of holineſſe</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 23.3.</note>. Or as it is in our tranſlation; <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of reſt, and holy convocation.</hi> And in Exodus, <hi>In the ſeventh day is the reſt of ceſſation, holineſſe to the Lord</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 31.15.</note>. And a little after that: <hi>In the ſeventh day ſhall be to you holineſſe, a reſt of ceſſation unto the Lord</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 35.22.</note>. All which do ſhew that on the Sabbath-day, which is the day following our ſix dayes of labour, we ſhould not only reſt from all our functions, and works of our profeſſions for getting of worldly wealth and maintenance, but we are to keep this reſt, ceſſation or ſabbath holy, to the glory and honour of the moſt great God our Creatour, and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Queſt. If any ask here, <hi>whether it be lawful for an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118373:56"/>Apothecary to let blood in caſe of great need; or for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to miniſter Phyſick to his ſick Patient on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtleſſe it is lawful: and not only ſo, but either of them may go, or ride for that purpoſe: it being of the duties before ſpoken of, for the preſervation of the life and health of mankinde, which are not forbidden by this Law; provided, neither of them do the ſame for his fee, reward and gaine; for then he maketh it a work of his Profeſſion, for gaining of worldly wealth and maintenance, which may be done on other dayes, but not on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, without making himſelf a tranſgreſſor.</p>
               <p>And now I conclude this point with the expreſſe words of the Homily for the time of Prayer. <hi>Thus it may plainly appear, that Gods Will and Commandment was to have a ſolemn time and ſtanding day in the week, wherein the People ſhould come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and have in remembrance his wonderful benefits, and to render him thanks for them, as appertaineth to loving, kinde, and obedient People.</hi> And with that a little before. <hi>And therefore by this Commandment we ought to have a time, as one day in the week, wherein we ought to reſt, yea from our lawful and needful works; for like as it appeareth by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that no man in ſix dayes ought to be ſlothful or idle: but diligently to labour in that ſtate wherein God hath ſet him: Even ſo God hath given expreſſe charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath-day, which is now our Sunday, they ſhould ceaſe from all weekly and work-day labour, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that like as God himſelf wrought ſix dayes and reſted the ſeventh, and bleſſed and ſanctified it, and conſecrated it to quietneſſe and reſt from labour: even ſo Gods obedient People ſhould uſe the Sunday holily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning the particular duties to be done on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, there being ſo many learned and godly men who have written ſo fully of them; and are or may be in moſt mens hands or cloſets; I forbear to ſpeak of them here for brevities ſake, referring the Reader to their plenty; and now in the next place will ſpeak of the ſecond part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>The great care and proviſion had by the Lord, for mans keeping and ſanctifying the Sabbath-day.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe former part of this fourth Commandment, which is, that we ſhould keep holy the Sabbath-day, hath been at large handled before; now it reſteth, that I ſpeak ſomewhat of the ſecond part alſo; which I will do briefly in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>In this ſecond part is ſet out in many words the great care and proviſion had of the Lord, that men ſhould obſerve this law, and keep holy the Sabbath-day as God commandeth. And this proviſion of the Lord ſtandeth not in one, two or three only, but in many and weighty inducements and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the leaſt of which ſhould have been ſufficient to inforce our obedience, had not our hearts been hardened, and we moſt rebellious, wilfully refuſing to yield obedience unto the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral inducements and reaſons the Lord uſed to win us unto obedience to this law are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, is the Caveat prefixed only to this, and to none other of the Commandments, <hi>Remember. Remember the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to ſanctifie it.</hi> This charge of heedfulneſſe would mightily work upon an obedient heart; he would every day of his ſix, be thinking how to do and diſpatch all his buſineſſes in thoſe dayes, that when the ſeventh day come, he may freely without any incumbrance, betake himſelf to the worſhip and ſervice of his God; and when it cometh will be mindeful of the day, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of obſerving and keeping the ſame holy as his God commandeth.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:118373:57"/>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord hath here plainly pointed out unto man, what day is the Sabbath-day which he ſhould ſanctifie. The Lord hath affixed as it were an Index to this law; that as the true houre of the day is known and pointed out by the Index or Finger in a Dial, whereby he that can but tell the number of the hour-lines, may eaſily know what houre of the day it is: ſo here, he that can but tell the dayes of the week, may eaſily tell what day is the Sabbath-day. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath.</hi> The ſeventh day is the Sabbath, not the ſeventh day from thy birth, nor the ſeventh day from the firſt beginning of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, nor from any ſet <hi>Epoche:</hi> for then it would have put the moſt skilful Mathematicians to a ſtand, for the finding out when this ſeventh day ſhould begin, but it is the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſix dayes of labour. In what countrey ſoever a man is, though he is not well skilled in the language of that place, and doth not underſtand what the names of the week-dayes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie; yet if he can tell which be their ſix work-dayes, he may then tell alſo which is their ſeventh day. It maketh not much by what names the dayes of the week be called, nor what the ſignification of either or any of the week-dayes ſhould be. The ſeventh day of the week with Chriſtians, hath been called by divers ſeveral names, and that even by Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuch as theſe, <hi>Sunday: The Lords day: The firſt day of the week:</hi> and in later times it hath been called alſo the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day; but in the firſt times Chriſtians would not call it the Sabbath-day, becauſe all the Gentiles deteſted the name of Sabbath, as the Jewes did the name of Sunday, as before is ſhewed: neither could they reliſh this name for a good while after their Converſion. It is not much matter by which of theſe names we call our ſeventh day; nor whether we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſignification of the name; as what <hi>Sunday,</hi> or <hi>The Lords day,</hi> or <hi>The first day of the week</hi> do ſignifie, or why we do ſo call our ſeventh day. Though he do not know it to be called Sunday from our Heathen Anceſtors, who called this day ſo in honour of the Sun whom they worſhipped: nor know it to be called the Lords day becauſe it is his Sabbath who ſanctified it: nor know it to be called <hi>the firſt day of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118373:57"/>week,</hi> for that the Jewes called this day <hi>the firſt of the Sabbath,</hi> and ſo was called by them in ſacred Scripture; and for that the latter Tranſlators of the Bible, would have this name by which the Jews called it, to be in our tongue, called the firſt day of the week; So as that now we count it not the day of the Sun, as our Heathen Anceſtors did: nor count it to be the firſt of our work-dayes, or firſt in order and tale of our week-dayes as the Jewes did. The name of the day doth neither adde nor alter any thing of the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is ſet down the equity of this law. It is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that none need complain. The Lord alloweth man ſix dayes, and reſerveth but one for himſelf. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh is the Sabbath.</hi> How unreaſonable are ſuch who are not contented with the Lords liberal allowance, but incroach on the Lords day alſo, which he reſerved for his own honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in that the Lord did in many words ſet down ſo punctually. 1. The works from which men are reſtrained. 2. The perſons who are reſtrained.</p>
               <p>The works forbidden are all kinde of Trades, Profeſſions and Occupations, which on other dayes men do or may uſe for getting their living and maintenance. There is no word in Engliſh, which doth ſo fully expreſſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which here the Lord forbiddeth to be done, as doth Function, Art or Occupation, as I ſhewed before, ſo that none can excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying, that his Profeſſion requireth little or no labour of the body; as do husbandry and divers other Handicrafts: for God forbids <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all Vocations, Functions or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations. Men ought to abſtain from all their works, of what Profeſſion or Vocation ſoever they be. Yea theſe works are not only forbidden in reſpect of the labour of the hand, but of the tongue and minde alſo; we ſhould not be talking of them, neither ſhould our hearts and mindes run on them on the Lords day.</p>
               <p>As God for the furtherance of mans true obedience to this law, hath fully ſhewed the works we are forbidden to do, ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118373:58"/>doth he alſo as fully, and in many words ſhew who are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to do any of theſe works; <hi>Thou, nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter, nor, &amp;c.</hi> Whoſoever hath any authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over himſelf, muſt not only be careful that he himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from his labours, but alſo if he hath authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over others, as ſonne, daughter, man or maid, Oxe or Aſſe, he is to ſee that they alſo ceaſe from all work-day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on the ſeventh day; he is not to imploy any of them: he nor any of his may imploy either Oxe or Aſſe, nor lend or, let them to hire for their labour on the ſeventh day, or on any part of that day. The Lords expreſſions are large herein, that ſo all pretences and excuſes may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Lord ſheweth here, and would have us to know that we have no right unto the ſeventh day, nor to any part thereof, for doing of our own works thereon, for the ſeventh day is the Lords day, and not ours, it is <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> (as it is in this place in our Bibles ſo tranſlated,) it is, ſaith God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Sabbath to the Lord: that is, a Reſt or Ceſſation to the Lord, as before I have ſhewed
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Chap.</hi> 8.</note>. It is a day holy to the Lord, and therefore none other then the Lords. All the tithe of the land, whether of the ſeed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, (in the time of the law) was the Lords
<note n="f" place="margin">Levit. 27.30.</note>, and ſo was the tithe of the herd or of the flock, even of whatſoever paſſed under the rod
<note n="g" place="margin">Verſe. 32.</note>, for the tithe of all theſe were holy to the Lord
<note n="h" place="margin">Verſe 30.32.</note>, and therefore they were the Lords; they were his ſeed, his fruit, his Lambes, &amp;c. One Lambe was no more holy then another when they fell from their Dammes; and before they were tithed out, the Poſſeſſor of them might have mingled them at his pleaſure; he was not tied to begin his tithing at one Lambe rather then at another; but from what Lambe ſoever he began, every tenth Lambe that in order paſſed under the rod was the Lords: he might not then change it, nor ſearch whether it was good or bad
<note n="k" place="margin">Verſe 33.</note>; it was then holy to the Lord, it was the Lords Lambe: and of ſuch as detained the tenth, the Lord complained that they had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him
<note n="l" place="margin">Mal. 3.8, 9.</note>. And ſo I ſay, concerning the ſeventh day in the like ſenſe, That one day of it ſelf is no more holy then is another.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118373:58"/>Chriſtians were not tied by any divine law to begin their week, or ſevening from any ſet particular time: but they continuing their accuſtomed week, and ſo beginning their ſevening from the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, the ſeventh from thence in an orderly courſe is ſacred to the Lord, it is the Lords day; no man upon his particular occaſions may change the ſame: he may not ſay, My buſineſſe is ſuch that I cannot keep this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, but I will keep another day in the week which will be as good. He doth deceive himſelf herein, he may not put off the ſeventh to another day, but ſhould defer his buſineſſe rather. When men take the ſeventh day which is ſacred to the Lord, and imploy the ſame about their own buſineſſe, either in whole or in part, they may as truly be ſaid to rob the Lord, as they under the law were ſaid ſo to do in not paying their due tithes and offerings
<note n="m" place="margin">Mal. 3 8, 9.</note>.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the Lord was pleaſed to ſet out unto us the ground of this law; why he would have a day in a week appointed for his worſhip, rather then a week in every moneth, or a moneth in every yeare: And why he would have the ſeventh day for his ſervice rather then the tenth; the ground hereof the Lord here ſheweth to be this; <hi>In ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, the ſea and all that in them is; and reſted the ſeventh day.</hi> The ſame ground for the ſanctification of the ſeventh day is alſo declared before in <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 2.3.</note>.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Lord declareth, and he would have his People hereby to know that he hath annexed a bleſſing unto this day: <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day.</hi> They who wait on the Lord, and ſerve him ſincerely, during this their day of attendance, ſhall finde the Lord a bountiful rewarder: their ceaſing from labour for doing him ſervice, ſhall be for their profit, they ſhall be gainers thereby.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if there had been none other reaſon or motive to ſtir us up unto obedience in a careful keeping of the ſeventh day unto the honour of God, yet this alone which the Lord hath given in the cloſe of this Commandment ſhould ſuffice; <hi>The Lord hath ſanctified it:</hi> God hath inſtituted it. But when the Lord hath given us ſuch a ſpecial charge of remembring the Sabbath-day to ſanctifie it, and hath ſo plainly pointed out
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118373:59"/>unto us what the day is whith he will have us to ſanctifie, that none may plead ignorance about the time, and how many words the Lord uſed in prohibiting all works, and in the enumeration of all degrees prohibited: laying down alſo the equity hereof, &amp; his own example together, with his bleſſing it and his ſovereign inſtitution hereof: how can any without pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ignorance, or wilful rebellion plead ignorance of the Sabbath? or knowing it, not yield ready obedience thereto?</p>

<pb facs="tcp:118373:60"/>then in other, and ſo firſt at one particular place when it was no where elſe the day of Gods reſt, either Eaſt or Weſt thereto. Both which are ſo againſt reaſon, that no underſtanding man will hold either.</p>
